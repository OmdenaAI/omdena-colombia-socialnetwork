"Answer: the protests are tied to a recent proposed tax increase.  The Colombian economy, like most nations, has contracted over the last year due to shutdowns.  The new proposed increase is seen as too much as it is far reaching and many cannot afford to pay more in taxes when many have either been working less or not at all.

Ivan Duque, the president, has asked that the bill be withdrawn and rewritten."
"Answer: oh wow finally something i can answer

shits been iffy for a while, there were protests before covid about the rising unemployment and rising taxes. then the gov's covid responce was pretty awful with the president and many governors and mayors giving conflicting advice.

some measures were also pretty extreme in impact to life and useless in actually stopping the virus. for example acording to your ID number you are allowed to go some days out and some days in lockdown (this just means i dont get sick today, tomorrow yes) and curfew at 6pm (which means all the buses were full at 5pm). we ended up being one of the highest covid infected countries, i think we made it top 5.

after that the congressmen were like ""damn we work hard, we need a bone"" and gave themselves a rise, if im not mistaken its also one of the highest in latin america? i might be wrong in the exact number but i think they earn 30 times the minimum wage. also they bought a lot of weapons, truks, tanks and planes for seemingly no reason and spent the money meant for relief.

now we have no money and gotta find some, so the president (who btw everyone hates and is offten acused of being a puppet of the previous president) set up a tax reform that rises most basic needs, services like water, electricity; foodstuff and medicine go up as well as gas; and theres both an income tax and a ""wealth tax"" that starts to hit as soon as 2 times the minimum.

they also made an analysis where they asumed average rent was like 1/5 its actual value and other crazy claims. then there were some interviews were the economics minister (sorry not sure how to translate the name) was like ""yeah suppose an egg dozen is 1800cop"" its actually 4500cop at minimum, the guy in charge of placing these taxes has no idea what stuff is worth!!!

all the while no changes were made to corporations or wealthy citizens who have tax breaks here and there. so people are pretty angry our gov is squeezing us for money while they missuse it and do a horrible job at everything.

phew thats a lot of background

as a result many protest have been ongoing in the middle of the pandemic, people are angry, statues are in the floor and the gov is starting to use those weapons they bought during pandemic. as of rn 32 people died in cali due to police just blatantly shooting into the crowd, some 40+ have disapeared, and a lot more are in bad conditions. say whatever you want about usa cops but at least they try to hide that they are evil douchebags"
"Answer: the ~~president~~ government of Colombia proposed tax increases and some privatisation of health care services to fund the expansion of a universal basic income social program. These proposals were seen to affect the lower and middle-classes more. The tax increases included hikes to value-added tax on food and utilities and the moving of some middle-income earners to a higher tax bracket. The privatisations were unpopular at a time where the health care systems are already under strain due to COVID-19, and Colombia has one of the highest death rates in Latin America.

A national labour strike was called throughout the country and the first protests began on 28 April. The protests continued in the following days despite heavier police and eventually military presence, and clashes between protestors and government forces."
"Answer: The recent protests against tax increases have been answered by increasing police brutality and abuse. The government has already [ordered the military to go to the cities](https://www.infobae.com/america/colombia/2021/05/02/ivan-duque-autoriza-militarizar-ciudades-que-han-sido-vandalizadas-durante-el-paro-nacional/) and contain the protests and is preparing to enter [a state of ""interior commotion""](https://www.elespectador.com/noticias/politica/uribismo-le-pide-a-duque-declarar-conmocion-interior/) that basically allows the president to take control of national media and be even more extreme in their approach.   


International organizations [including the UN](https://www.elespectador.com/noticias/el-mundo/onu-y-union-europea-condenan-exceso-de-fuerza-contra-manifestantes-en-colombia/) and the EU have asked the government to stop human rights abuses, and the UN and human rights activists that went to Cali yesterday, where [the police were straight-up shooting at civilian](https://twitter.com/UNHumanRights/status/1389532975637934083)s, [were victims of threats and aggression by the police itself](https://twitter.com/ONUHumanRights/status/1389442909020332032), they say some activists were even shot by them (thought not the UN representatives), but none of them were injured.   


As for victims, here is [some data compiled by a human rights ONG](https://twitter.com/TembloresOng/status/1389327457250156545), this was up to the 2nd of May, and they spoke about (at least) 26 people murdered by the police, and hundreds of injured people. Cases of people [who lost their eyes](https://actualidad.rt.com/actualidad/384582-joven-manifestarse-bogota-perder-ojo-esmad) due to irresponsible use of non-lethal (or straight-up illegal) weapons are pretty common, they have been since the 2019 protests, and there are at least [two reported cases of rape and sexual abuse by the police](https://www.eltiempo.com/colombia/cali/paro-nacional-investigaran-denuncia-de-violacion-por-policia-del-esmad-585276).   


As you see, the situation is pretty worrying, and this is only what I can remember right now and what I can tell you to try and explain. News will generally talk about the tax protests but at this point the protests are more against police brutality than anything else. This is usually what happens in Colombia. (It was the same last year and the year before that. The [9 of September of 2020](https://www.vanguardia.com/colombia/septiembre-9-cronologia-de-un-dia-de-terror-que-empezo-con-la-muerte-del-abogado-javier-ordonez-BJ2865461) was a precedent to what is happening right now every day since the 28 of April)  


I do not want to link videos because they are pretty striking and some people might not want to see them, but there is plenty of evidence of the violence that is happening right now. You can look up the related hashtags on twitter if you want (#ParoNacional or #SOSColombiaDDHH, among others), but I warn you, there are pretty striking videos of the police shooting and killing people at close range, videos of people running and falling to the ground while the police is head shooting from behind them, and some pictures of bodies and really horrible shot and burn injuries, so yeah, think twice before looking).   


Everything I said is supported with evidence in the links, but since they are mostly in spanish, I'm willing to answer any other question about them or about the topic if you want."
"Answer:


Colombian here:


The context:

- Covid fatigue.

-Economic crisis.

-The very high possibility that we are pawns in a geopolitical game between China/Russia : Venezuela and the USA : Colombia.

-We do have very a very VERY high taxes on companys and besides value added tax (VAT) / sales tax the middle class (i belong here) doesn't pay a thing.

-Out of control public spending(due to our parasitic political class from all sides left to right, that want to keep leeching of the government and for people to keep paying for it).

-Our security forces are all militarized (yes even the police, they are not for the most part prepare to deal with CIVILIAN unrest) due to the whole conflict/drug issue.

-Most important the PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS  are in a year and we are a HIPER-PRESIDENTIALIST democracy.


The tax reform: 

Basically it was going to make us, middle class Colombians pay more taxes besides value added tax (VAT) / sales tax (for the first time) alongside other increase things ,  in order to finance the whole covid crisis and give subsidies, some sort of UBI for the poorest people, like extreme poverty. 

The communication strategy for the tax reform was laughable, truly laughable. Big mistake given how close we are to the next presidential election.

Our current president is weak, was put in that position by his boss (yes, he has a boss) and that doesn't go well in a HIPER-PRESIDENTIALIST democracy such as ours.



The Shit show:

Protests began to oppose the tax reform  people got riled up by politicians from the left at first then from fucking everyone (again we are close to a presidential election and we are a hiper-presidentialist democracy this is very important).

The clash between protestors and the police it's been rough specially in the pacific region (historically abandoned) and some big citys. 
Since the government's party (i profundly dislike these pieces of shit) it's a pro-police and pro-military party they are protecting and justifying every horrible thing that they (police) do, including killing protestors, raping, beating up protestors, unlawful arrests, etc.

The most infuriating thing about the whole tax reform, is that nowhere and i mean fucking NOWHERE there is mention of REDUCING PUBLIC SPENDING, because we have a bunch of parasitic politicians and their families clinging to the government to suck every bit of money out of it and they are not going to touch their own priviliges.



And all of this it's happening while we are having the worst Covid outbreak (it's going to get much much worst in the weeks to follow) since this pandemic started.

The tax reform has been withdraw.

I'm probably missing a very few things, i think. But this is it."
"Answer: Hi everyone. I'm an 18 y/o from Colombia. Even though the BBC covers the issue slightly, it's much more worse than that. 19 confirmed deaths aren't even close to what's true. Siloé, a town near the city of Cali, has been completely massacred, with people struggling to get food and resources due to the government blocking the roads. On top of that, social media access has been all but forbidden, with people being totally missing, nearly no news have been found from this place. Cali, as well as Bogotá, have been militarized and are being held at gunpoint, police are using tear gas that's gone past it's due date, shooting at children, even at windows in homes and apartments. There's been rape, abduction, death, fear and hopelessness. We need to be heard, we need help, so please help me by sharing this and making it reach much more people.

Don't let us die in silence."
"Answer:  (Oh shit, finally something I can answer)

There's a lot of conflict, and many things people would point as the first one, and it has escalated a lot over the past seven days. 

**TLDR**: People started protesting about 7 days ago, requesting that the governemtn withdrew the Tax reform that would increase taxes in poor people, and severely reduce the funding for arts, healthcare, and other social services. The govt is excusing the hikes in the pandemic. 

As many social protests, there's been property damages, and clashes with the police, and during those clashes the police have murdered and kidnapped several protesters, and it seems that private fascists groups are aiding the police, at hurting the protesters with complete impunity. 

The president made some weak changes to try and apease the protestors, but people are too fired up, specially after witnessing murders in livestream, and won't hold back until the president resigns, or real change is proposed. More protests by Colombians around the world are being planned to bring more awareness. 

People are afraid now that the governemt will continue escalating the situation and murder a lot of people, like they did in 1988 in the palacio de justicia event. 

**Longer version** The current president of Colombia is considered to be a puppet of Alvaro Uribe, a Colombian ex president. 
Alvaro Uribe had his start in politics working with Pablo Escobar, and he has been in lists of important narcos since at least [1991](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB131/).

During his government, the country took a sharp turn towards fascism and neoliberalism, privatizing a lot of services, limiting access to healthcare, and worsening conditions for workers, unions, public schools, farmers, etc. His government was lauded however for supposedly weakening FARC, a political terrorist group in Colombia. However, most evidence point to the weakening of FARC as a farse, and during that time the government kidnapped and murdered at least 6402 civilians to inflate their numbers. And in the past few years, [hundreds of activists](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-colombia-peace-feature/murder-of-hundreds-of-colombian-activists-casts-shadow-over-peace-process-idUSKCN1VF0IK) have been murdered with complete impunity, and people feel that there's no hope of finding a peaceful transition to the future. 

Bringing Uribe up, because many people believe that this protests are inteded to finally rid Colombia of the poisonous influence of Uribe, many posters, signs and organizers are ""antiUribistas"" y ""antifachos"", and believe that as long as he continues having any influence in politics, the country won't be able to move forward. 

Hope that helps, happy to expand more on it. Fuerza Colombia! 

Sources: my hometown is the one mainly in the news, Cali, Colombia; several family members are in the protests, and my parents work in politics."
"Answer: 
I dont know about the politics of it specifically, but i am living in manizales and i can see the brutality fromy balcony as i live on the main street in the city. The police here are nothing like usa, they are behaving like they are in a mid-evil war. Police cars are driving full speed through crowds of people, 5 police will be beating a single man with batans, cops will casually shoot people from their motorcycles - people who are just alone walking and talking on their cell phone. Its another world. Also, tear gas is really painful, i experienced it from my 5th floor balcony... But police will shoot tear gas cans into public transport buses that are full of elderly, babies and families. Its horrible and i am not sure how these police can convince themselves to do such horrible things"
"Answer: I'll try my best.

Iván Duque, current president of Colombia was elected on 2018, he was the candidate of the party of long time and right wing politician (yeah, right wing) Álvaro Uribe, who is remembered by some of battling hard against the FARC guerrilla between 2002 and 2010, where they reported 10000+ deaths in combat. This man, Uribe, proposed a constitutional reform where the president could be re elected a second time, and then a third time. The latter reform was rebutted by the Constitutional Court, deeming it as anti democratic. Around that reform were a lot of complaints about corruption, and then at the very same time they were investigations in about the number of deaths on this period of time. At least (by that time) 3000 people targeted as combatants but they were just young innocent people killed and presented as guerrilla soldiers. 

The mechanic was as follows: people presented a job opportunity outside the city, mainly a farm, and the kids were with them. they the military forces shot them, and changed the bodies outfits to present them as guerrilla soldiers. Some of the bodies had their boots put in the wrong way (the right boot on the left foot), and some other people were just autistic people or young men with disabilities. Recent investigations found that 6402 of those deaths presented as in combat were, in fact, innocent people killed by the military.

There is info here about that https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/19/colombia-false-positives-killings-general-mario-montoya-trial
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-56112386

Why do I have to start the story so back in time? Well, because as Uribe  couldn't be re elected president as other people in South America (but in the other side of the political spectrum: Correa, Morales, Kitchner, Hugo Chávez) he supported candidates who won in every election except on 2014, where Juan Manuel Santos was re elected as the man who would make a peace treaty with the long time guerrilla FARC. Santos was Uribe's candidate on 2010, but he just went against his supporter in order to follow his own program.

Then, 2018 happened. Iván Duque was elected as the counter measure from the other candidate who was supported by the Venezuelan regimen (you people on the USA now know this rethoric, used in the latest elections, but it was us, colombians, who came up with it: a new take on McCarthism), and the one who said it would be uniting all people under the same flag.

Well, the guy was a flop. At November 2019, people were on strike because Duque presented his second tributary reform, where he was allowing more taxes to the middle class and exemptions to big enterprises. So, yeah, he united all people against his reform. 

https://nacla.org/news/2019/12/12/rejecting-inequality-and-state-violence-colombia

Then the pandemic came. Just take in mind that the strikes proposed by the people were at the ending of 2019, so 2020 could had the same tense situation if the government kept their usual response: police oppression, and that yadda yadda yadda.

Well, because police oppression is normal, as you can see around the world. Just people hitting on other people. 

Then, September 9 2020 happened. Following the events of Floyd's death on the USA, another similar thing happened on Bogotá, where a civilian was killed by the police.

https://nacla.org/news/2020/09/14/protests-against-police-brutality-spread-colombia

This was now on COVID's time, where almost 2 million people lost their jobs and many business broke. Where help from the government came as a TV show where the president was talking about COVID for one hour, every day, and where there was proposes an economical stimulus for the poorer people of the country, consisting of U$ 20 bucks. So, when you hear about UBI, here in Colombia the response was about 20 dollars for some people. So, people were pissed. We were on the streets marching and then police used live rounds against protesters. On those events at least 5 people died on the first night of the protests, and there were acts of police brutality that came on the next days as the protests continued.

Then, January came. With the announcement of the vaccines the government said that there were negotiations with all the Pharmaceuticals in order to get the vaccines, but the contracts were not allowed to the public, and as of today only 7 million doses were obtained, and a little less were administrated. We are 49 million, so people were pissed.

Then, the next tax reform was announced. It proposed tax implementation on food and primordial articles that are know for being  essential to the people, and other taxes as the one on the amount people received as salary if they earned something like U$8500 a year. Some appliances were going to be taxed. Also, the big chunk of this reform was to get something like 6006006006.006 USD from the middle class, where the government gave bailouts to the banking and aeronautical sectors, these industries from people who always supported Álvaro Uribe and his party. So, we were really, like really pissed.

Also, from that 6 billion USD that the reform was going to get, almost half was to buy some military grade planes so we could beat the Venezuela threat. Yeah.

The main excuse the government had for that reform was that some social programs were in danger, that the only money we had was to run the country for something like 6 weeks (https://forbes.co/2021/04/07/economia-y-finanzas/a-que-se-refiere-carrasquilla-al-decir-que-el-pais-tiene-caja-para-6-semanas/), but the previous two reforms presented by this president made a huge hole on the country's finance. Those exemptions to the big companies (banking, aeronautical, oil, carbon, big agro) meant at least a 8 billion dollars (more than the amount the third reform was going to cash in) deficit in taxes. There was, also, corruption.

So, the thing you are reading on the news right now it's because Cali, one of the big cities on the country, is being raided by the police every night, with some help from the army, where they are shooting at people, gassing autobuses, buildings (yeah, condos, where people live), and it is said (this is not yet confirmed) that veterans from the armed forces are encouraged to shoot people protesting on the street. Sure, they were some acts of random violence, but as far as I know, in Colombia we don't have the death penalty, and surely not for revolution, but some people (Álvaro Uribe's followers) think that the country could be better without that kind of people, so they are OK with protesters being shot.

Sorry being a liltle bit cynical at the last paragraphs, but my heart is aching for my country. It really really really has been a tough week.

"Answer: the puppet president proposed creating or increasing taxes for funeral services, eggs, tap water, internet, coffee, chocolate and pensions, among other things; he even suggested putting toll booths inside cities (we have way too many tolls in our roads and those are neither cheap or justified). He was thinking ""I got rid of half the taxes I proposed and people would be relieved"". He was wrong."
"Answer: The Colombian government had planned to raise taxes by 19% on a population where most people only make $2 an hour. This sparked PEACEFUL protests. Then the government started to shoot PEACEFUL PROTESTERS. This escalated the problem to be a more inclusive protest for reform. The government cut off the population by turning off the internet, cutting phone lines and getting rid of cellular data. They have also been telling other countries that the only people they're killing were rioting. The government has been seen shooting civilians walking down the street, throwing tear gas into busses with mostly children, throwing explosives into crowds, and driving vehicles through demonstrations. They have also infiltrated CANDLELIGHT MEMORIALS to the people that THEY KILLED. This is why everyone who has heard eyewitness accounts is angry and why the other countries aren't doing anything.

Having said that, after some of these events the people have rightfully been rioting. Generally I disagree with any sort of violence but what else can they do against people who are using LITERAL FUCKING WAR CRIMES AGAINST CIVILIANS? here is a link to the anonymous video

Spread the word Please they really need it"
Answer: The goverment proposed a tax increase that was very controversial (for a simple example in the proposal there was a tax if You die)
"Now that Im out of the top comment I want to state how odd it is that governments are proposing tax increases during a recession.  That is the opposite of what modern economics suggests anyone should be doing.  At this point governments should increase spending and decrease taxes in order to promote consumption and thus growth.  

Note if you recently cut taxes while the economy was strong, which again is the opposite of what modern economics would suggest doing, you won't see much of an increase in consumption so you must resort to direct financial stimulus."
"One thing the top comments are missing is the corruption piece. It's not just that taxes are being proposed, but it's also pretty much assumed that the taxes being paid already are not being used for the public good. Anecdotally, 
 My fiancee is a public accountant, aka. she deals with taxes related to government funded or organized companies. The amount of corruption she saw was only the tip of the iceberg. She has struggled against shady companies trying to scam the public but she is expected to just make the numbers look good and look the other way."
"AFAIK, people are not just mad at the fact that a shitty tax increase has been proposed at the worst time possible - which let me add, increases taxes to first necessity products, public and **funerary** services, but also the incredible amount of police brutality the country is seeing during protests against the reform.

So far 21 deceased, 4 raped women (by the hands of the riot police), 12 students have lost an eye and around 940 people have been hurt. You can find videos of this online, especially one where a dude randomly walking down the street gets hit in the head with a smoke canister by policemen cruising around in motorcycles.

Edit: A viral [Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/COcpfGzHZXN/) explaining the situation"
* 2021 - The year of “*Fuck around & find out…*”
"And to top it all, the supposed president is just a puppet following orders of the narco criminal Uribe, an ex convict that managed to permeate congress with a far-right mafia disguised as political party and even become president. Since then he won't leave power, since he knows if justice is ever to come, he'd be sentenced to life in prison."
"What is happening in Colombia is not something that ended with the widrawal of the tax reform, as a result of the protests there's ongoing police brutality against civilians. There has been rapes, open fires on the streets, irregular detentions against protesters... Yesterday in the city of Cali happened something that can be considered a massacre on the streets. [These ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Colombia/comments/n4zzbh/por_favor_compartan_esto_no_para_please_share/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) are some of the latest numbers."
"Yes, but it’s not only a tax reform during a recession/stagnation. It’s important to point out the tax reform would impact the lower and middle classes more than the upper and political class—which have generational wealth and connections.  

Even the president, Duque, is an establishment politician with ties that go back to Centralistic Democratic families for decades. Mainly Uribe and his political branch of reps...

These new taxes would tax the working class and middle class at a time when many of them don’t have the resources to even afford rent. And in some cases benefits the higher and political class because on average they make nearly 15-20 times the country’s average yearly salary. For instance, Colombian congress makes 23 times the average citizens salary and they pay almost no taxes."
"To add to this, they are also protesting via economic targets. So for example, the protestors are targeting the airport in Bogota, which is where a significant amount of floral products are exported out of the country. Floral is a massive economic category in Columbia, so that’s a pretty effective target."
Withdrawn and rewritten you say. Was this before or after shooting at citizens?
It's important to note they didn't actually do anything to have the reform withdrawn and rewritten. They only stated it was going to happen but a few days later no legal process has been made to stop it
And you have to consider that the country  has millions of venezuelans immigrants
Does anybody know where the cartels are in all of this?
Full war out there
"The protests going on in Colombia are not normal protests due to proposed tax bill. They are blocking main streets in all the major cities for more than 4 days. They are destroying,  burning metro stations and major transportation infrastructure. They are looting stores, including supermarkets.  The tax bill was just an excuse. They continue blocking and destroying  even after the tax bill was removed.
The leftist movements and former FARC senators want to completely destabilize the country by destroying infrastructure, blocking transportation, and disrupting normal flow of food, medicine, and goods. They have recruited thousands of people to block entire cities for several days. People can't get out of their houses to go to work, to shop for food. These people are violating human rights of the entire country pretending to be peaceful. There is nothing peaceful about starving people, looting, and destroying key infrastructure. But when the police and the army take action, they immediately cry human rights violations. 
Mayors of the 3 largest cities are extreme left sympathizers and they have purposely allowed the blocking to happen by not engaging their police forces in time to protect citizens.
It's a planned misinformation and government destabilizing campaign."
Isn't it because officials stole a lot of money too..?
"Specifically the new tax law focuses on taxing foods such as milk, eggs, and gas while it also cuts the corporate tax law even further. Additionally there is a current proposal for privatization of the universal healthcare of Columbia and other counts of austerity which has further impoverish the working class of Columbia via the current right-wing regime."
"It goes way beyond that. The tax reform was just the straw that broke the camel's back.

The colombian people are protesting to end an unfair, violent, corrupt regime that squanders this country's wealth on a very reduced minority of oligarchs.

We're fighting against systemic racism and abandonment of vast areas of our country, against corrupt media that only shares fake news. And most importantly, against a thinly veiled fascist regime posing as a democracy that has no qualms shooting at unarmed and peaceful protestors to keep the status quo.

This isn't a revolt, we're fighting for our rights and being slaughtered on the streets by the police and ESMAD (SWAT). 

Let me be clear in something. This protests aren't politically motivated. There's people of all ideologies taking part in this. We are fighting for basic human rights and equal opportunity, and they are answering with brutal force.

Of course, there's some extremists and third parties taking advantage of this situation to seed chaos and violence, but the vast majority of protestors are peaceful and just want justice.

The withdrawal of the tax reform is a sham, it's been proven that the president gave the green light on proceeding with this unfair cash-grab behind closed doors and ignoring any democratic consensus.

EDIT: got carried away, this last paragraph is a mostly accepted rumor, but a rumor nonetheless. Still,  stopping the tax reform is not an excuse for murdering civilians

Source: I'm a Colombian living through this hell and not backing up"
"Althought from what I understand Colombia has a very high corporate tax rate, what I'm hearing they did is heavily increase taxes on all the middle classes but particularly not the rich."
"Also I would like to state that Duque is said to be a puppet of the previous president Uribe and not Santos. Colombia has a history of having right-wing presidents, even our precious president who was considered left of center in Colombia would easily be considered right wing even by American standards."
"lol the politicians giving themselves a raise. That reminds me of when teachers in Canada were fighting for a 1% raise and they told us to fuck off. Then they turned around and gave themselves like an 18% raise or some bullshit. They did the same to the nurses. 

Why the hell aren't we rioting in Canada? Our housing prices are through the roof and the government still wants to pump it up even more. Sometimes I wish we would be like other countries and just go hardcore protest. Instead in Canada we complain about it, then just leave it."
"Shooting... live lethal rounds? Is there footage of this? The only think I’ve seen is someone posted an overhead view of a crowd scrambling over the sound of shots, but it’s not clear who is shooting, nor what kind of weapon is being used. The comments weren’t helpful as people were only expressing outrage and not interested in learning more important details.

Edit: There's disturbing footage of police firing live rounds at people. Commenters have shared these links:

unrelated but I suddenly started to see some Colombian social media accounts with Colombian flags as profile pictures. I wonder whether they are protesting the govt or supporting them?
"The being pawns of other governments is a very big factor, but nobody is really talking about this.  Although, I would put it as China/Russia/Venezuela. Colombia needs to be really careful.

"Beautiful comment. Thanks for writing that, I hope your country finds peace soon. Solidarity with the people of Colombia."
Totally agree this country is totally corrupted
"I'm just an armchair economist here. You make a good point about deficit spending during recessions, but I think that probably depends on countries being able to borrow. The US for example has good credit and can easily take on loads of debt. It might not be so easy for Colombia."
"Is also a tax increase in the poor, is considered that their intent is to increase opression, not revenue."
I am assuming Biden tax increase proposal doesn't play into account with what you said because not many make 400k or more a year. Is this correct?
"It all depends on what your situation regarding public finances.

Say, you are a mid-tier country in terms of GDP with no particular advantage on your currency you could use like the Americans do on their dollar. And say your deficit is extremely high (like it is for Colombia due to coronavirus), then your run the risk of losing the market’s confidence in your ability to pay back your debt.

I am not saying I agree with what I said but there is definitely a case behind solid financial budgeting.
the reality is that most countries do not decrease their public debt during good economic years, so when crisis comes, you end up being forced to increase taxes to keep people’s faith in your ability to pay back.

Colombia isn’t the European Union or the US. They can’t just print money and let the rest of the world pay for it.

Furthermore, I don’t know if there is an absolute truth in economics. As much as I have strong convictions economic theory, I don’t think we can easily say that something is obviously true and should always be applied no matter what.

When Europe got into an existential crisis in the early 2010’s, Ireland and Greece reacted very differently.
Both countries asked IMF findings and both had to increase taxes. Yet, the results were on short-medium ter very different for the two countries.

I would also add that now that all the efforts Greece did, the situation is getting way better than other European countries who didn’t do the effort.

So, yeah, difficult to always prove there is one truth in economics. Every day is new."
"The problem is that their bond ratings are one notch above junk status. If they fall below that line their borrowing costs will increase. This bill was crafted to reorder the financial house of Colombia. 

Also, other economies are expanding. Colombia in particular seems to be doing more poorly than her neighbors."
"The thing is that the government is almost broke and needs to finance it's debt. Right now TES (colombian treasury bonds) are being treated as below investment grade (even though we technically we still have it), and most likely we will loose our investment grade if something is not done about the fiscal deficit. Also, the reform proposed a large increase in spending in the short and long term (which I don't agree with) with things such as a direct payment to poor families (see ingreso solidario, a kind of UBI) and trying to make public universities free for the lower strata (colombia is divided in 6 stratums depending on where you live and your income). But all these things need to be financed somehow, so taxes."
"Ideally yes, you should increase taxes and fatten up the piggy bank when the economy is strong, and decrease taxes and increase spending when faced with a crisis. However, many countries are currently in an arms race to see who can please giant supercorporations the most and give them the best fiscal advantages, so what should be a very big part of any country's tax income isn't there and many countries are operating at a loss *during the good times*, while cynical conservative politicians tell us that this is the way.

Tell Ireland and Andorra to play fair, for example, and maybe many other European countries wouldn't be in this deep shit. But Apple ain't gonna pay Spain or France their fair share of millions in taxes that could help with recovery from this crisis when they can pay about tree fiddy and a Happy Meal in Dublin.

So don't think proposing tax increases is odd, money is needed and we would have it if tax elusion wasn't so rampant across the globe. In Spain there's been a proposal to tax huge fortunes a little bit higher and the usual suspects have been saying it's a travesty, why tax the rich when we could close schools instead."
"The taxes are because the government has been funding a lot of public health programs, expanding hospital capacity and providing relief for vulnerable families who lost their income.

I personally don't mind that there's a tax reform right now. The problem is that the tax reform is charging less to the wealthy and just taxing the middle class. If the wealthy and the middle class both had to help the poor and vulnerable it'd be a different story, but laying the entire weight on the middle class is something else."
"The current goverment is [losing support](https://www.semana.com/nacion/articulo/el-uribismo-perdio-en-las-elecciones-regionales/638176/) so their last hope is a [monthly payment](https://www.semana.com/nacion/articulo/ingreso-solidario-que-pasara-con-el-programa-tras-el-retiro-de-la-reforma-tributaria/202157/) that will be available until the elections start. so that way they can gain votes, this policy is unsustainable and will do 2 things after the presidential elections

1. if they win they will stop it saying that the economy is already 'recovered'
2. if they lose the next president will have to stop it and they will say that he doesn't help the country or care for the people, and that way they can gain support again.

The policy doesn't have any real economic reason or logic, is just to collect money and give it in exchange of votes.

The goverment actually had a lot of opportunities to save the economy in the middle of the pandemy and instead of supporting local economies or saving jobs they just gave  money to big banks that have ties to the goverment, and also bought [military](https://www.infobae.com/america/colombia/2021/04/02/llegaron-a-colombia-cuatro-aviones-militares-norteamericanos/) [weaponry](https://www.asuntoslegales.com.co/actualidad/colombia-es-el-segundo-pais-la-nivel-latinoamerica-con-mas-inversion-en-gasto-militar-3160701) and supplies for this protests. this is just their last chance to swing the support of the people to their side, this president has made 2 tax reforms in 3 years, this will be 3 in 3 years which is just absurd

 (All the links are in spanish sorry, i couldn't find english sources)"
"> That is the opposite of what modern economics suggests anyone should be doing.

Is it?  
I mean, that would normally be true if in a ""regular"" recession, but if the current situation in Columbia is similar to what's going on here then they're in fairly unique occurrence and doesn't really follow the typical rules for how you mitigate the damage a recession causes.  
Most recessions are demand-driven, so increasing spending (or lowering taxes) help because they create more demand and counteract the recession.  
The current recession (at least here) has a major supply-side component, so increasing demand isn't necessarily going to help because it doesn't actually address the problem."
">  I want to state how odd it is that governments are proposing tax increases during a recession. At this point governments should increase spending and decrease taxes in order to promote consumption and thus growth.

Many people in Europe have been saying exactly that to many other people affiliated with the European parties right of centre like the EPP and Renew, which have dominated European politics for the last couple of decades. Even now we can already start hearing them pushing for more ""structural reforms"" of heavily indebted countries. At least they're coupled with some spending to prop up some economic sectors, but I'm not sure it will be enough."
"This idea is flawed anyway. The core concept is that in a recession you increase spending by borrowing money and then when the economy recovers you reduce spending and increase taxation in order to pay off the loan. In theory this prevents the boom and bust cycle and gives stable growth instead.  Seems simple and logical.

What it doesn't consider (and what economist very often fail to account for) is that people don't really work this way. We are not rational actors, we are guided by self-interest and impulse as much as rationality. In this case, governments change as new elections happen so the government which is expected to reduce spending isn't the same as the one that borrowed the money. The new government has a strong economy which is bringing in a lot of tax revenue. That money can be used to pay off the loan, or it can be used to provide services to citizens which will make the current government look good and the loan can be the next government's problem. Rinse and repeat."
"Don’t they have a porous border with Venezuela? I can only see this leading to more smuggling goods through there, and thus a further drop in GDP."
"we call this the Ricardian Equivalence - doesn’t matter if you cut / raise taxes spend more / less - all you do is shift the tax increases into the future, the capital markets react immediately and any supposed economic growth etc. is offset by other changes in the general equilibrium of the economy. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricardian_equivalence"
"I personally don't feel too bad about raising capital gains taxes in the US for individuals who make over a million dollars annually from it. Other things like infrastructure and COVID stimulus need to be financed through reconciliation, and having capital gains taxes more closely align with income tax brackets reduces an unfair advantage that contributes to wealth inequality."
"Agreed but some institutions, i.e. IMF, World Bank, sometimes require that you have a specific payment plan for them, e.g I'll cut these social services and pay you back with that money, or, I'll raise a fuel levy of 16 percent and that will generate enough income to pay this loan. 

That's where austerity comes from, the lenders requiring higher taxes and lower benefits and cuts to social programs to qualify for a loan."
"Not everyone has been hit the same way. The rich got richer and the middle and lower class got hit harder. Taxes should never be increased at the same rate for everyone. For example, a 10% hike for someone making $100 a month is a big deal. A 10% hike for a billionaire, they are not sleeping on the streets."
"Where do you get these ideas of modern economics? Do you have good videos, articles, sources, etc. I can read up on?"
19% on anything and everything.
It's what we're doing in the US as well. I can see the US revolting/demonstrating as inflation starts to kick in from the recent spending at the exact same time government help drys up. Unfortunately the current party in charge has decided it's ok to buy votes by either mailing a check directly (with a follow-up letter making sure you knew the money came from Biden) or government programs. It will be interesting to see if they can keep the masses at bay long enough for the next election to take place.
Well Biden in the US is raising taxes AND printing like crazy. Politicians dont ever downgrade their money flow.
"The government is going broke, that's really the main reason. Corruption, mishandling of funds and all the costs of the pandemic (basic rent for some, buying vaccines, covering wages, etc) has drained the government's reserves"
How would they increase spending without taxes? Loans?
">governments should increase spending 

Many goverments are already deep in debt"
"Not only that, even though the reform has been taken back at this point, there's still a lot that has been left purposefully out such as the Reform on Health that would make it so that you'd have to pay premiums for certain sicknesses you contract, and if the insurance considers you liable for having gotten those illnesses you'd have to pay as well. 

People right now are also protesting for the use of deadly force against civilians. Dozens of people have died at the hands of police brutality and them shooting randomly at peaceful protesters. Police brutality all around."
"Colombia can't print stimulus money like the US can. Colombia relies heavily on lending from abroad, and if it is unable to repay to international creditors, it'll have a very difficult time borrowing in the future. The tax reform, however painful it may be, is badly needed to balance the countrys books, especially in the international stage... All those vaccines we're getting aren't free."
"The problem is that in a lot of countries (including the US) there is a lot of political pressure that has resulted in lopsided tax burdens and outsized government spending. These problems emerge in times of plenty and are difficult to reverse when economies contract.

In short, governments are bad at saving money and tend to spend it like a sailor on shore leave.

The result is that the government has an enormous operating expense and a system that disproportionately taxes working people. When the money runs out, which happens \*very\* fast, the only option is tax increases on the working class, which just makes the problem worse but is needed to maintain government operations.

Theoretically, big countries like the US can take on debt to handle this problem, but again, the pressure to spend-spend-spend is always there and even big countries tend to dip into that credit system pretty heavily even when they don't need to.

That right there is the big old flaw in the whole democratic republic concept. Big fiscal decisions are made by politicians, most of whom are not going to be in office long enough to be held accountable for the decisions they make."
"Near the end of an exogenous recession and not likely to take effect immediately. Basically, it's a tax for the recovery boom."
But Reddit kids think they can just keep printing money.

That is the opposite of what modern economics suggests anyone should be doing. At this point governments should increase spending and decrease taxes in order to promote consumption and thus growth.


The problem is politicians only want to raise taxes when they absolutely have to because people want the same. Nobody wants to raise taxes during a boom for a rainy day fund for the crashes because that is politically unpopular."
"There in paper the reform was excessive since it covered MANY basic items like eggs, milk and such but where the money was supposed to go was not bad per se, thing is on a country with such high corruption rates its unacceptable to give the government any more money"
"This is Colombia we’re talking about, probably not the greatest economic minds in power…"
"> Note if you recently cut taxes while the economy was strong, which again  is the opposite of what modern economics would suggest doing, you won't  see much of an increase in consumption so you must resort to direct  financial stimulus. 

That's a fact, look at the U.S with Trump. Economy was all time highs but yet huge cuts... total scam."
Smells like massive debt and the origins of a bubble that will pop sooner or later.
"> Now that Im out of the top comment I want to state how odd it is that governments are proposing tax increases during a recession

Its very well possible they are proposing the tax for like next year, which will probably have a economic boom."
"> At this point governments should increase spending and decrease taxes in order to promote consumption and thus growth.

You really need to differentiate what type of taxes we’re talking about here. 

Income, capital gains, corporate, consumption, progressive, regressive, property, inheritance etc. 

To say “taxes” without specifying which kind of taxes is intellectually dishonest, and doesn’t make the argument you think it does.

It shows more so that you don’t know the nuances of what you’re speaking to."
Consumption doesn’t promote growth stupid Keynesian
"> Colombia has a very high corporate tax rate

on paper it does but there are many exceptions trough [Zona franca/Free economic zones] that rich bussinesses tend to manipulate to get a better deal, most of the corporate tax in practice is never actually taken

>what I'm hearing they did is heavily increase taxes on all the middle classes but particularly not the rich.

thats basically the spark, yes"
"You are right, may i add: People have been asking for subsidies (UBI, and that kinda stuff), the money has to come out of somewhere!!! This is what i think most Colombians don't understand (I'm Colombian), there is no such a thing as a free.

- The most infuriating thing about the whole tax reform, is that nowhere and i mean fucking NOWHERE there is mention of REDUCING PUBLIC SPENDING, because we have a bunch of parasitic politicians and their families clinging to the government to suck every bit of money out of it and they are not going to touch their own priviliges."
"right, its the ex-ex-president, minor slip

i think a lot of confusion comes from the fact that right/left is more of a spectrum than a single line. and the discourse in colombia has just made all meanings muddy from all the fearmongering so to me i dont care, i think paying less atention to those labels helps me keep a better neutral point"
"I don't agree with the whole ""right wing"" part, i think that there is no right in Colombia.

There is a group of anti-guerilla - Pro- police - Pro-military and very catholic (so is the ""left"") politicians. That's it, in every other way that counts there is no difference between them and the ""left"".

You are 100% right about the guy being a puppet."
Aren't they basically puppets to US imperialism?
"There is. We only know this because people have taken it upon themselves to Livestream and share this on their personal pages. The media is censoring what's going on. Check Instagram and twitter and you'll see many. Videos of people getting shot mid Live Stream. Bodies falling in the distance. Groups of people performing CPR and Stop the Bleed on fallen comrades. A mother crying at the hospital doors about how they killed her only son, a 19 year old, and how she wanted to go meet him in heaven. The police and anti rioters (ESMAD) are the ones using lethal force against civilians. Here you can't easily get guns (it's illegal, in fact) and protesters don't have them."
"There is a lot of footage, a man was killed during an Instagram live. We all saw it."
There has been 26 deaths caused by the police and 1181 police brutality cases. They are killing us.
"Not really sure how I can link you to it or even find the video anymore since our social media is just completely full  and saturated with videos right now but yes. Yesterday night there was a video of anti riot agents with what seems to be machine guns entering one of Cali's poorest neighborhoods, where a candle vigil was being held to conmemorate people who had died in the protests. The agents disrupted the scene and killed a few more people (including a 10 year old boy) even thought it was a peaceful demonstration. There's been several pictures of the huge bullets people have found on the ground in the morning after these kinds of attacks. Bullets only approved for rural and mountainous landscapes. 

Some of the anti riot munitions exploded in a hotel that was storing them too, the hotel burned down and the protestors were blamed. There's also some kind of war trucks patrolling around the city, they look like literal tanks and while I'm not sure, they seem to be able to shoot as well.

Several people have died even with ""non lethal rounds"" because the agents have disregarded appropriate shooting training and are aiming tear gas canisters, amongst other things, to the head, the eyes, and other delicate parts of the body.

I hope this provided some context. I live in Cali so unfortunately I've seen more of those things than I would like to acknowledge.

I was able to find [these ](https://youtu.be/_ql-5XztJG0) [videos](https://youtu.be/Cbk7MiAa0mg) in [YouTube ](https://youtu.be/29ewugfQIQQ) however. They show some the police brutality I've just mentioned."

Gracias amigo! palante!
"Thanks. ya is absolutely devastating.

Colombia is hard to be like left/right, specially things like FARC. 

Alvaro Uribe, and his party, are right wingers, neoliberals, they're the party in power. They're all about military, autoritarianism, war on drugs, thought on terrorism, etc. Most protesters are protesting against them, and identify as leftists.

AFAIK there's not a real strong left leadership in the country, there's a few scatered senators, and some people cosplaying as leftists for popularity. 

FARC started as a movement of farmers, that wanted self determination and protection, because they felt abandoned by the government. They shifted a lot, but eventually they abandoned all their philosophy and focused mostly on revenue, kidnapping people for ransom, and providing security and logistics help to narcos. People were pretty disapointed in FARC and have condoned them for years, after their peace negotiations with the government, the leaders of FARC were able to launder a lot of their money and retire, and their regular soldiers were abandoned by them and the governemtn; and a lot of the communities where tehy were are now abandoned. 

Many FARC ex-soldiers that don't have other work skills, and were used to having some money or power, have formed gangs to work with narcos, and is believed that they create a lot of conflict and isues around the rural areas.

Hope this helps a bit!"
"We did. Uribe is a very cunning and smart guy, I don't support him personally, but it is true, Colombia became relatively safer during his time and international investment and tourism increased rapidly, however this was at cost of cutting lots of social programs, and the rising of paramilitary groups, which are as awful as guerrillas. 

So yeah, that stability was gained with the blood and tears of civilians. I have very very conflicting thoughts about it."
"ya. but with fascism. he hid a lot of stuff under the rug. murdered a lot of political oponents, and activists, and killed more than 6402 civilians and passed them as combatants to inflate the efficacy of his war. 

the farc and other narco groups came to different arrangements where they split the country, and stayed of each other’s lane, and that also helped give a sense of peace. Cocaine production in Colombia keeps increasing every year even with all the money thrown at this war."
"Agreed, it's why EU had to make a recovery package because some countries didn't have good credit and couldn't borrow a lot due it costing too much. While other countries in Europe like The Netherlands basically could borrow money for ""free"". So, the ""bad credit"" countries could borrow more due to using the good credit of others."
"It's exactly this. The US has the ability to go almost arbitrarily deep into debt (maybe, we're not actually sure how far we can really go) but lots of smaller and poorer countries are actually constrained."
"The original school it came from (Keynesian economics) had taxes raised  in good times to build a surplus that offset the deficit spending. Only issue was that this second part was politically unpopular and went against the ""growth=good"" economic policy that underpins all economic decisions."
"I know next to nothing about economics except vague memories from HS economics class years ago, so genuine question- how does the US have good credit?? Aren't we like, a couple trillion in debt and rapidly counting? Are we paying any of that back? Because I know if I took out a bunch of loans from different places and didn't pay it back, my credit score would be fucked, and eventually the only people willing to lend me anything would be cash advance places and loan sharks."
"When you owe a debt in a currency you control the supply of, you don't have a debt problem, you've only got an inflation problem."
"The problem are Also some of the proposals for example: 
tax if You die
If You die your pension Will to the goverment
And a medical reform that all workers lose benefit exept the president"
"More than that, the US dollar is a reserve currency.  Other countries rely on it to bolster their treasuries & banking systems."
"Which is why countries should practice balanced budgets, saving for when things go bad. Reality is countries spend spend spend and when shit hits the fan, borrow to spend more. All this does is decrease wealth for the middle class."
"I am myself only an armchair economist but 
>The US for example has good credit and can easily take on loads of debt

The US is already in tonnes of debt isn't it? How can they take on more debt if they've had to raise the debt ceiling every year/occasion for as long as I've been alive? I only know about the US having more debt than they could possibly pay off, I don't know that the US has actually paid back any of the debt they have"
Colombia does have its own reserve bank too though... it could use errr ‘quantitative easing’.
"That’s “Trickle down” dogma.

Reagan and Clinton both raised taxes when the economy was down.

It worked for Ronald Reagan.  It worked for Bill Clinton. Together, following their tax increases, nearly 40M new jobs were created. Bill Clinton even generated budget surpluses.

Of course, there was much else going on, both in the economy and otherwise during those periods, that makes it impossible to isolate a single causative factor.  But that, really, is the larger point: raising taxes in a recession is not always good, but it is not always bad either."
Colombia have a respectable calification acording to risk analysis firms
You’re spot on. The reason they’re trying to raise taxes in Colombia is to raise the credit rating.
Why doesn't Columbia not just print extra money?
Place corruption in the equation and then you will understand more the situation here
Correct
"> the government has been funding a lot of public health programs, expanding hospital capacity and providing relief for vulnerable families  

I wish... although it is partially true, Duque's government  has been known to spend money in unnecessary things (even before the pandemic), so it comes to no surprise people are against the tax reforms when you know the government will just make the money disappear and probably pocket it somewhere else. 

I would also be in favour of the tax reform if I knew the money would go to where is needed, but I distrust this current government too much for that."
Colombia*
"Not a lot to smuggle. It’s more of people illegally moving gas and food (sugar, eggs, rice) due to huge imbalances of supply and demand, gas is cheap one one side, rice is subsided on the other. Its’s a very poor and ignored area and smuggling brings enough money to feed whole communities (even in the Colombian side). And it cause violence between the smugglers, buyers, armed groups and police. But not a drop in GDP from loosing tariffs and immigration fees or from the local industries that suffer from an influx of cheap goods, it’s just not that rich of a region to make a difference to the wider country. 

It definitely makes the communities in border communities very vulnerable and dependent on smuggling. But the governments of both counties neglected the region before and they don’t seem to change now. The most that has been done are a few “cierre fronterizos” or temporary closings of the border roads and bridges (mostly by Venezia or because they are more vulnerable to smuggling screwing up their food subsidies). But that doesn’t really stop smuggling

"You're very optimistic. It probably will not because in this country the breach between the poor and the rich is HUGE, and the middle class is oftentimes actually just poor people with a few accomodations. This proposition only puts a lot of pressure in these already fragile sectors because it's 19% tax in everything including funeral services, electricity, gas, water, internet. These are daily life expenses. The rich do not care. They don't even know how much food costs. This is setting poor people to fail and go hungry."
Progressive and regressive aren't specific taxes but rather are ways of describing how a tax functions so it's odd to see them in the midst of types of taxes especially from someone commenting on my level of understanding.
Im not ascribing to a school only focused on what works.
"Ya, that sounds familiar to how it is here in America too.  ...all these corporate taxes on paper, but they always find loopholes to wiggle out of paying it. 
  I swear, almost  ALL governments globally are corrupt beyond repair.  This world is going to seriously implode soon!"
"I'm an ex-pat and from what I understand, Colombia provides a decent amount of public services, but it's right that they do spend a lot of money on raises and other non-socially helpful items."
"I think you are not taking into account the power of the government to print money into existence by buying bonds. Yes, this is a dangerous game that can devalue the peso. But the country is already in recession which has a far worse consequence. This is why developed countries have been buying bonds like crazy.   


This is also ignoring some expenses that don't make any sense, like the billions spent in fighter jets while the global pandemic was beginning."
There is a clear difference between their respective economic policies and public policies. The most recent healthcare “reform” points to that. It’s tough to measure left and right in Latin American countries that have multiple political parties just because of the amount of self-interest involved.
Alejandro Ordoñez would disagree with you on that.

well. there definitively is an armed guerrilla. more like a shiton of armed guerrillas. but i dont think the are really involved in the revolts

I never knew even countries had a credit score.
So what I’m hearing is some countries need co-signers to get loans. Huh! TIL
I am ignorant. Would you please explain why it is the US can have so much debt as a country when we are already so far in the hole??
The US shouldn't be spending money
"As long as people and other countries are willing to buy US debt, then the US can borrow more money. It's all about confidence that the US will pay back the debt, which they always have done, so far. The debt ceiling is a self-imposed limit, and has no bearing on whether people are willing to buy US Treasury notes."
The US is constantly repaying debt. If you buy a treasury bond you are guaranteed to be repaid when it matures. They're considered almost risk-free because the US has never defaulted on it's debt.
"Printing extra money is another form of tax on the public. Yes they can print more but that da values the money that every citizen has. For example 1 dollar could buy a cookie, but the government prints so much money, it’s easier to get money, so the cookie now becomes 50 dollars. So if you had 10 dollars you still have 10 dollars but can no longer buy anything with that money because it’s worthless"
"Raising taxes on the wealthy does not reduce consumption. In fact, it extracts hoarded wealth and injects it back into the economy in the form of government spending in infrastructure. 

Raising taxes on the poor and middle class does reduce consumption, as they do not have a hoard of wealth to tap for spending. they simply adjust to do without.  
  
Raising taxes on the rich and cutting taxes for everyone else would be a double-stimulus."
"Isn't what you are discussing something that isn't just basic? I would rather read an article, opinions from professionals, etc. I would think that the issue you mentioned wasn't as crisp and clear and there would be debate over it."
"Well I got one from Biden. It came after the deposit. All trump did was make sure his name was on the check. Biden sent out a ""please thank me letter"". Now sure where your getting your info"

"Well it's not really a credit score in the sense of personal credit scores.

It's just a basic risk to reward analysis.

It's much more risky to loan Afghanistan 100 billion than France.

Eli5

Basically they just look at how stable the economy and government is and if their gdp can support the loan easily or not.

Standard & Poor runs a pretty good analysis where you can see various countries rating.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_credit_rating"
">I never knew even countries had a credit score.

They do.  Its essentially the interest rate they have to offer on government bonds. 

As an example:

The USA is current offering **2.3% on 30 year bonds**.  So the USA can pay you pretty crappy returns because you know they're good for it.

Contrast that to Agrentina which as defaulted on its government bonds in the past and is currently offering **49.594% on 10 year bonds** [source](http://www.worldgovernmentbonds.com/country/argentina/).  Its a great return...if you get paid back.  Lots of folks have been burned when the government *didn't* pay back bond holders.  So there's a price for that risk."
It boils down to how likely the country is to default on bonds it issues which is just credit for countries.
It's not a credit score but a rating on their bonds( debt). The higher the interest the riskier it is.
They sure do. There are professional sovereign credit analysts.  I used to be one.
"Banks run the world, son. 

Welcome to the new world."
"Because there's still demand for that debt. People buy US government bonds at extremely favorable (to the government) rates. At some cases below the rate of inflation. Basically borrowing costs are extremely low, and as long as that persists there's really no reason not to borrow."
"To rephrase what other people are saying, the US is able to “service” its debt consistently, meaning to repay some of the borrowed amount every so often. 

So long as a country seems like it can repay a little every year or so, it is reliable from a lender’s perspective. 

Countries ALWAYS want to borrow money because that is more money to spend NOW for your people and get yourself reelected. 

In the case of Colombia, perhaps they cannot borrow enough due to their unreliability, so they turn to taxing. Very general assessment."
Foreign banks will buy us debt.  They won't buy a small poor countries debt.
"If you have $100 in debt, with a monthly paymentt of $10, and you make $1000 a month, you can easily afford it. If by taking a $1,000,000 loan with a monthly payment of $10,000 and investing it nets you $50,000 per day, it's basically free money. 

The US has a great return on investment and they always pay up all of their debts on time, so they're given credit at a ridiculos low rate, it's even more of a ""free money"" situation."
"You are not so far in the hole.

You might look like it if you look at total debt, or debt to GDP, but if you look at the interest payments of debt as a percentage of the budget, it isn´t so high ... it was higher before the 80s."
"The IMF and World Bank force many small countries and impoverished former-colonial states to peg their currencies to the US dollar in exchange for access to loans and favorable access to foreign capital. US influence in these and other international trade organizations gives them power in trade negotiations which force other countries to accept these terms or face trade embargos, political sanctions, or in the worst cases, military intervention. It's essentially forcing significant portions of the world to adhere to a gold standard, except only the US can print the ""gold.""

The modern global economy is also heavily reliant on debt. US debt is considered safe because the people or countries taking it on just assumed, ""well it's the US, *of course* they're good for it."" The problem is how over-leveraged we are at this point. But like that old saying, ""if you owe the bank $1000, that's you're problem. If you owe the bank $1000000000, that's the bank's problem."" Having an (at least for now) stable US market to continue offering debt financing as well as a market for goods to help service that debt means the US is sort of indispensable at this point. And thus the US becomes sort of untouchable if you want to collect on any of those debts. If China were to say they were nationalizing all US debt and coming to collect, the US economy, and then the world economy, would collapse and make it so that the debt could truly never be repaid. You know the movie Speed where they can't slow down the bus below a certain speed or it'll explode? That's essentially the global economy now.

Finally, if push ever truly came to shove, the US has the most powerful military on Earth by a factor of lots. As much as they love to shit on communists, they certainly took Mao's idea of ""political power growing out of the barrel of a gun"" to heart. So the whole thing keeps chugging along because the US can keep printing the closest thing to gold underpinning the global economy, any individual who tries to call the game would collapse the whole thing and take a small chance of ever getting repaid down to zero, and ultimately, you can't collect a debt from someone who doesn't want to pay and can kill you without even changing out of their pajamas.

The neoliberal dogma about austerity and free trade being the keys to success are pushed by powerful countries like the US even though the US doesn't adhere to any of it. It's the post hoc justification for maintaing a global empire, with enough bombs to turn the world into a parking lot providing the incentive to believe it. So the US is... special. Whether that's a good thing or not is left as a question for the reader."
ELI5 answer- the US is good looking. Colombia is the dude in the friend zone.
Because we will pay it back. Other countries have histories of being unable or unwilling to pay back their loans.
The simple version is that the US is far richer. Its like giving a $1000000 loan to Bill Gates vs giving a loan to my gran who is a retired cleaner on basic state pension.
"Because of the 14th Amendment:

> The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law . . . shall not be questioned. 

Our debt is so safe that during the 2008 recession the US Treasury was essentially paying negative interest rates - *making* money (after inflation) by borrowing.  People were willing to borrow at those rates because everything else was seen as *worse*."
"But the US credit score is going down, its not in the same rank as for example sweden, norway or germany"
Why not?
Doesn't the concept of a debt ceiling become utterly pointless if they just keep raising it? It seems like the US is more and more willing to spend more than they can to keep the idea of US excellence high but they're failing to make due on any of the money they're borrowing.
Because it can just print dollars to repay debt?
I mean isnt that exactly the thing the west is doing for years and still doing it?
"Exactly. And from the looks of things, Colombia is raising taxes on ""everyday goods and services"", which disproportionately impacts low & mid income populations and barely affecting the rich. 

No wonder they're protesting."

What do you think a personal credit score is? In fact country and business credit ratings are about half a century older than consumer credit ratings, so consumer ratings are probably inspired by those."
"Yeah, like invading Russia in the winter, the world has failed to learn to not lend Argentina money.  It has defaulted on its debt NINE times since it's independence."

Which is the same thing as a personal credit score facepalm af.

"Actually, Colombia has been quite good at paying back for decades. The puppet president tried to guarantee that that was not going to change in the foreseeable future and that's what the tax reform was for, to establish a sustainable reliable taxing system. The problem is: this is not the moment, those taxes are way too high, there are too many tax cuts he doesn't want to touch and no one believes he and his party are not going to use that money to go to war with Venezuela or something because there is no accountability because he has the justice department wrapped around his finger."
"The ""service"" is the high spending on the military to keep the failing dollar afloat. World Bank goes brrrrrrrr, interest rates rise. The ""cost"" is on the already faltering working class."
"Countries can always pay back their borrowings in local currency. They just print the money. The question is whether anyone wants that money, like if it will kill the foreign exchange rate if they print a bunch of money. 

So much international commerce is in dollars that it has resulted in growing demand for dollars for decades. People aren’t so conscious of the advantages the US gets from that.  The US can print dollars and people still want them. 

When a country borrows in another currency, the issue of how they will have the money to buy the currency to pay back the debt is more heavily scrutinized."
Not just foreign banks. Not just foreign investors. Your retirement fund likely has some US debt in it. US debt is seen as guaranteed unless the apocalypse comes.
"> The IMF and World Bank force many small countries and impoverished former-colonial states to peg their currencies to the US dollar.

Source for this?

Most countries I'm familiar who opt to tie their currency to the dollar, do so to maintain a stronger export industry. Argentina, China, and Japan come to mind in the last 20-years (with various types of soft pegs)."
But you can't forget that the US destabilized the whole region in order to profit from it. The banks that loans the money with ludicrous rates and etc. all benefited from it.
"The debt ceiling is purely political. Yes debt is increasing, but the government is certainly making due on the money they are borrowing: paying interest on bonds and repaying bonds when they mature. The fact that the government reliably services its debt is the reason why the credit rating is so good and people are willing to continue buying government bonds."
"The debt ceiling is a political hostage, basically. Politicians can threaten to not raise it in order to get something they want. It doesn't really have any reason to exist other than it has existed before and changing anything in US politics is hard. Rule of thumb is that inefficiencies exist precisely where somebody is ""taking their cut"", and by that nature they are hard to eliminate.

The US pays back debt very reliably because the economy, and corresponding tax revenue, grows reliably. Standard procedure for any large entity, you take a loan and invest it such that the return pays for the interest and then some."
"The money used to pay the national debt comes from taxes as well as other debt (e.g. somebody buys a new bond and that money goes to pay off another bond). If necessary the government could raise taxes if it needed to repay a debt it couldn't cover with what it had at the time; for example if congress failed to raise the ""debt ceiling"" and required everything to be paid off without borrowing any more, one way to do that might be to raise revenue via taxes. If they couldn't raise revenue to pay off the debt for some reason, then the government would have to default on the debt. Russia ended up doing this in 1998 ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_Russian_financial_crisis)). Since the US has never defaulted on it's debt in it's history it is considered an extremely safe investment.

Simply ""printing more money"" can actually make things worse as it can lead to hyperinflation. This happened in Germany in the 1920s. ([more info](https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/85/economics/national-debt-printing-money-and-inflation/))"
Yes which is why the United States has had a steady inflation of 3 to 4 percent a year. It’s basically a hidden tax. But hyperinflation is where it gets really scary. When printing so much money the currently is devalued by more then 5 percent a year. Some countries like Argentina see a 30 percent devaluation a year due to this. Impossible to save money
"> I mean isnt that exactly the thing the west is doing for years and still doing it?

You'll have to be more specific than ""the west"".  In the USA we did 3 rounds of it (called Quantitative Easing) to recover from the great recession.  The last of those ended in Oct 2014.  In Sept 2019 we started again to ease the strain on financial markets because of COVID19.  That round ended in July 2020.  So right now it is NOT occurring in the USA.

">What do you think a personal credit score is?

If you take on debt and pay it off too quickly, your credit score goes down. Your 'high revolving credit' means that while you're a safe bet in that you have a track record of paying back your loans, you pay them before they can acrue meaningful interest and are therefore not profitable. A personal credit score is essentially a rating for risk/reward analysis of lending you money as opposed to just risk."

"I believe Ha-Joon Chang talks about it in his book [Bad Samaritans](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1032019.Bad_Samaritans).

The argument being it ""strongly encourages"" --but essentially forces-- underdeveloped countries to rely on the export of consumer goods and raw materials to wealthier countries in order to survive rather than allowing them to develop competing domestic industry. It also means these countries lose domestic control over their own monetary policy and leaves them competing with one hand tied behind their back on the global stage. This is a great deal for places like the US or Europe, but for countries like Panama or a lot of the OPEC nations, it perpetuates their reliance on and thus subservience to the currency-controlling powers."

"I haven't read his book, but from the reviews of the book I've read, Chang's point appears to be more carefully delineated than that. That *certain types of free trade* are undesirable because the negative externalities that arise from things like unconstrained capital flows.

Pegging to the dollar is one of a family of countermeasures designed to curb those negative externalities that Chang appears to identify, such as giant swings in currency values resulting from domestic economic downturns. He similarly identifies ""cheating"" on IP issues. He appears to be a bit of a fan of China's approach -- who long used a peg to the dollar.

>export of consumer goods and raw materials to wealthier countries in order to survive rather than allowing them to develop competing domestic industry.

But typically exporting is exactly how domestic industries develop. Until there is sufficient home-grown demand, exporting subsidizes the development of industry. This is exactly what China did. Made cars for the west for 20-years until the country became wealthy enough to develop an internal market.

"That's ... not true. Even if you don't use it, it reports that you made your payment on time. Something else caused it to drop, because usually increasing your credit limit lowers your utilization which INCREASES your score."
"High 700s vs low 800s isn't significant. For any serious loan, the lender will do more than check your score. Also, for example, I got a 0.9% promo rate on my car loan 3 years ago with a mid-700s credit score. Which was not higher because I'm younger, still had substantial student loans and moderate CC debt that I didn't pay off, but I never missed a payment.

Lenders care 10x more that you reliably make payments than almost anything else."
"I don't think this says what your previous comment says. In the most common scenario if you close a line of credit, now you have less money available to you, so your score goes down. Say you start with two credit cards with $20k limits, one with no balance and one with a $10k balance. This means you have $30k available to you and 25% utilization. If you pay it off, you have $40k available and 0% utilization, both of which are better and would improve your score. But if you pay off your credit card and then close it, now you have $20k available and 0% utilization. It would have been better if you kept that credit card open."

How dare you try and save on paying interest!
"If you don't have much credit history, your score was counting on this loan...now that the loans gone, you are back to no real long standing credit history. Im just assuming this based on your 114 drop. If you have a few accounts older than 10 years with no lates, I'm wrong."
"Ideal situation for maximum credit score. If you are a creditor, you want to maximize profit while minimizing losses. People carrying maximum debt loads are high risk for default and may not be able to use their cards on a regular basis, decreasing the profits from transaction fees."
"Except no part of the equation is whether you pay interest, or whether you pay off debt ""too quickly,"" or even how quickly debt is paid off. This is a misleading myth that persists and can cause people to make costly financial decisions that have no benefit."
Enough that it's more wrong than right.
"Woah! Easy there, if you are bringing american politics into the conversation that's a whole other beasts with it's own flavor and characteristics.

We are talking Latin america politics, which is very, VERY different to USA politics.

Every description you just gave matches almost  perfectly, like word by word ,many political parties in the region (again Latin America) that go from ""socialist left"" to ""fare right"". Authoritarianism knows no boundaries."
"I could see being over-extended (credit limits too high for income level ) being a negative.  Same with a sudden increase in credit limits.  But I always thought this was general credit report data that lenders will interpret as they wish, not something that's included in any of the mainstream credit scoring models."
"So let's say I pay off an auto note. It's not like I suddenly have less credit available. If anything I have a stronger income to debt ratio and I would be a better lending candidate. Buy since I have less active accounts I'm less profitable.

The same goes for your example of closing out a credit card. wouldn't someone with fewer open lines of credit be much safer to lend to than someone with more given the same income?

>Say you start with two credit cards with $20k limits, one with no balance and one with a $10k balance. This means you have $30k available to you and 25% utilization. If you pay it off, you have $40k available and 0% utilization, both of which are better and would improve your score. But if you pay off your credit card and then close it, now you have $20k available and 0% utilization. It would have been better if you kept that credit card open.

Better for who? Having a credit card carry a $0 balance on a $20K limit isn't doing you any favors. If you close it out, that does not make you a higher risk to loan to. Your income doesn't change, so your ability to pay back your maximum amount of debt (20k vs 40k) increases if you have a lower limit. But credit scores are not there to gauge the safety of the loan alone, but also the profitability since there is a lot more $$ to be made by the lenders if your balance increases."
"Keep the accounts open, just don't rack them up."
your right. I do have a few other things on there. but I went about 15 years without using any credit. then just started this year after I realised I basically have no credit score anymore. but it still proves the point that your score will drop if you pay stuff off early
Except your wrong unless we’re having an issue with semantics. I’ve just recently bought 2 houses and am very aware of how a credit score is calculated. All I can say is to google it. The ratio you described is certainly part of it. But far from the whole picture.
Its not at all wrong though
"The difference is that left-wing parties advocate to total change, or revolutions, whereas right-wing parties advocate for keeping things like they are. This is the same all over the planet, since the time of the French revolution."
"A credit score indicates how likely you'll repay a loan, not how profitable lenders think you are. You can see that example here in Myth 1:

>Actually, credit scores are more a reflection of the way you handle your  credit than the amount you carry. Simply having an ever-present balance  won’t do anything to help your score, but responsibly [paying off your debt](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/category/finance/paying-off-debt/) will.

Yes, paying off a car loan is mostly good for your credit score, but if you have very few accounts then your score would be highly uncertain which would be bad for it.

Yes I agree that a credit score is a highly problematic way to know if someone will pay their debts. For example the fact that it doesn't know anything about your income or spending habits if it doesn't travel through your credit accounts. But in your example, it would be much safer to lend to someone that already has open credit lines with other institutions, assuming they have low utilization with those accounts. This indicates that other institutions trust you to repay them, which is a good sign. It also means that if you end up owing one person money, you could borrow it from other people who trust you in order to pay that debt.

In terms of credit scores, having a $0 utilization of a $20k credit card is absolutely an excellent component of your credit score. If you closed that out, your credit score would very likely fall, and it should fall, because it means you're declining access to $20k in money that you could otherwise use to pay debts, and your utilization rate would rise. Yes, ideally in many cases it's a bad strategy to pay off most debts on credit cards, because credit cards generally have very steep rates and fees compared to most other debt, but it's always better to have the \*option\* to do it, assuming you have the self-control to safely use the credit card, as a $0 balance suggests you do.

"I intentionally made the decision to close them out knowing that it would hurt my credit. It was just a thing to let me sleep easy at night. Plus from what I understand it's really only on more predatory lending like credit card and car loans where they focus on the credit score now days. Mortgage lenders will probably look at your actual history and have their own internal calculations that they do which will generally ignore drops due to things like that.

It's just a stupid system overall that is designed to encourage bad spending habits."
"I'm not wrong. My job necessitates I understand how credit scores work, as I practice consumer debtor protection law. You do not have to carry a balance to build your credit."
It's like 90% wrong. Like if I said the sky is blue because oxygen absorbs the other wavelengths.
">Yes, ideally in many cases it's a bad strategy to pay off most debts on credit cards, because credit cards generally have very steep rates and fees compared to most other debt, but it's always better to have the *option* to do it, assuming you have the self-control to safely use the credit card, as a $0 balance suggests you do.

Its a super bad strategy for you, but if you're still making payments on the debt that is securing your other debt, that's *great* for the lenders. The way I read that, it's making my point for me. 

If your credit score was just to gauge how safe it is to loan to you, your ability to build up debt, pay it off, and close the account should be ideal. 

If you need to keep a line of credit to potentially offset other debt that would mean that you're not secure enough for the initial loan, and it should raise a red flag about your finances. 

Fact is, the folks who are safest to lend to are the folks who can pay back a debt. If they have access to your credit/payment history they shouldn't need to see that you can maintain a 0 balance on a disused account in real time. 

But, most credit cards have annual fees so they love seeing that 0 balance. It's free money for them."
"Why dont you pick something that you have an issue with.

Because hes 100% correct."
"Sure, using a line of credit indicates that you have less money than if you just paid every debt off in cash, but plenty of companies and individuals have lines of credit they use to even out the flow of incoming and outgoing cash. Having access to that credit line means you're healthier than if you didn't have access to it. There are lots of reasons why you wouldn't  want to constantly float enough money to make sure you had enough liquid cash on hand for literally everything you ever had to do. That's not an unhealthy indicator at all unless you're actually needing to constantly carry balances, hence the utilization calculations in your credit score.  


Maintaining a 0 balance on a credit line you have available indicates that you aren't spending above your capabilities, so that's a good indicator. But sure they may not \*need\* any particular account if you have others showing a good history already.  


Plenty of credit cards don't have annual fees, but yes if your credit card does have fees then you might consider closing it, as my previous link mentions. But if it's not costing you time or money, there's not really a reason to."
"Not even close. Why are you arguing? No, seriously, this is a question of epistemology : what makes you think you know that he is right?"
"The point that I'm making though is that your rating shouldn't *drop* if you're closing out lines of credit. 

Sure, there are lots of good reasons to keep open lines of credit, but penalizing someone's score because they no longer need it and therefore close it does not make sense if a credit score is an indicator of risk only. Especially since my point was primarily WRT closing out debts (like paying off an auto loan early) not lines of credit."
