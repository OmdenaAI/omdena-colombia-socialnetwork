Edit: please report comments that break rules. This thread has over 200 comments"
1,How much the police brutality helped to the grow of the protest? People in favor of the government justified everything the police do?
2,Can someone explain the tax reform and what the governamment were proposing?
3,"Argentinians in this thread rn are like that ""you guys are getting paid?!"" guy from the meme"
4,"It's interesting to see that the proposed tax reform for Colombia is very similar to the one the Costa Rican government is trying to pass as part of its commitments to the IMF for a relief plan.

CR is in a similar deficit situation and, thanks to the pandemic, the previous fiscal reform (from 2018 which saw VAT added to services and income tax hikes) showed how short sighted it was in not doing anything to curb spending. So they proposed several taxes last year including more income tax hikes and tripling property taxes. This resulted in a series of protests which made the government backpedal.

They learned from the experience and now introduced the new reform as part of the IMF commitments, with the most vague and surreptitious wording, trying to confuse people and avoid more protests. Things are astonishingly similar to Colombia: lowering the exempt ceiling and changing income thresholds that at least for me will result in a very hefty tax burden increase. It will be interesting to see what happens here when it enters  actual discussion (the government does not have a majority and there are elections next year), so this unfortunate Colombia case can point a bit to what can happen here."
5,Can someone ELI5?
6,Colombians: how are you and your families doing during this time? Do you have a sense that the violence will persist or even escalate from here?
7,It's so weird that Colombia's tax hike would be a tax cut here
8,"Someone knows what is a ""Revolución molecular disipada""? Uribe tweeted about how the State had to resist to this supposed revolution. But I've never heard about that term before."
9,"I feel like the comments here have the same issue the current president (Duque) of Colombia has. They're written by people out of touch with the country who have no clue how most people live or how it functions. They think it's the United States or some other place, or they've only been around and lived in the high income areas of Bogota. Even the tax reform changes they've listed are completely wrong. But this is easy to understand. The actual tax reform bill is not the full story. There were many different prepositions that were introduced in the media that did not make it into the tax bill, and overall the entire process made people extremely angry.

It probably has to do with the fact that millions of people don't have jobs having lost them during the pandemic and the country is in the midst of another massive wave of infections.

&#x200B;

There's also the big unspoken fact that more than half of the national budget is stolen through contracts and in Political Salaries which are extremely high. In fact one of the only decent job you can have in Colombia is in fact, being a Politician.

Colombia is a country where the entire political system is designed to ensure control of all wealth production remains in the hands of few who also happen to be the people who control the drug trade, it's economic system doesn't even qualify as capitalism. It is a Narcostate. [To understand modern Colombia you need to watch Gilberto Tobon's video's,  the preeminent authoritative figure on Colombian politics.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTfryt5LnY0)  Any forms of business that threaten the rich ogliarchs ends up being regulated or destroyed by corrupt police, drug linked assasins, or paramilitaries. It's the opposite of a free society. There is frankly little to no social mobility.

Even all this lovely infrastructure that you could say that taxes are used to pay for is used to further control and limit people. There are crazy high road tolls throughout the country (Average fee being around 20,000 pesos for one car, which is the equivalent of $5 and more than half a day's minimum wage, that would be like a toll in the US being $30), hell one of the new propositions of the law was to allow placement of tolls inside cities themselves.

&#x200B;

The Colombian people are angry naturally, because of all these tax dollars that are taxed, little of it is spent on anything they see that actually benefits them.

**And herein lies the great myth of Colombian taxation and wealth. Colombia's government and economy is not poor, there is not a lack of tax funds or money movement. In fact Colombia's Government and economy has massive amounts of money it can spend. The majority of those funds are wasted and go towards the pockets of rich people and politicians instead anything that helps the common man. So why the hell would common people want to continue to raise taxes when they know that most of it is going to go to pay off corrupt politicians and businesmen?**"
10,What's the capital gains tax in Colombia? Has there been any proposals to increase it over there?
11,I have a dumb question. Most of what I am seeing is from Cali. So I am wondering if there are also a lot of protests etc happening in Bogota and medellin and other cities? I know that there was when it first started but wondering if those cities are as bad as cali
12,"As a Colombian living abroad I feel very sad. We could’ve changed things. This presidential term was of utmost importance: it was the first after the peace treaty with FARC. It wasn’t perfect by any means but it meant hope for a lot of people! But no, Duque (representing everything wrong with Colombian politics) won and I knew we fucked up. However I never thought that we had fucked up this bad. Duque singlehandedly destroyed what could’ve been a very promising future for all Colombians.
Sorry for the long post. I’m very disappointed but mostly just sad."
13,"27 murdered in less than a week, WTF. I guess Duque can do anything as long as he isn't Maduro."
14,"I agree that the tex reform is needed, BUT they want to tax very basic products like coffee, eggs, milk, etc. they also want to tax the internet and install urban tolls, i.e. within a city, you would have to pay fees in order to circulate. Everything will become more and more expensive. The government claims they will refund the lowerst class, but we know that most of that money will get lost like it usually happens in this country.   


At the same time, people like me, who earn more o less two minimum wages per month (on average) are not elligible for that refund, because statistically speaking we are ""wealthy"". This affects the middle-class more than anything and super rich ones don't get taxed accordingly. This is so unfair for young people like me who are trying go ahead.   


All services will become more expensive for me and no one will help me. But you know what makes me angrier? That the police acts like a bunch of maffiosi. They are dangerous and if I go to protest today, it's because I am appalled by the situation yesterday. .I won't vote for Petro or any uribista, I am sick of this s."
15,Very sad and awful situtation. I dont know much about Colombian politics but watching some of these videos of protesters being shot and killed is just horrible. I am praying for you Colombia!!
16,Anyone have news from Cali?
17,"What the hell is going on in Colombia? I'm from Romania and I've just seen some posts on twitter with the Colombian special forces brutally attacking civilians who were protesting. This hasn't been on any major news channel over here in Europe. 

Can someone give me TLDR?"
18,"Can anyone explain the scale of these protests/uproar?

I keep trying to find out how bad it's getting but news articles are very vague. Is this like an Arab Spring revolution or is it like Portland Oregon where the protests are only 1-2 city blocks?"
19,Do you think president duque will be forced to resign?
20,"There's no chicken, no eggs, no milk, the potatoes' price is now 4 times higher, no gas. The rioters are blocking even the ambulances that don't carry critical patients.

I understand the riots, the reform was really bad planned and they should honestly reduce public worker numbers and their salaries instead of fucking us with more taxes.

The only thing I fear is the rise of Petro to power as he's using this crisis to gain popularity."
21,Is some type of tax reform necessary for the stability of the government? What is likely to happen if there are no tax increases at all (even a different version that avoids affecting low-income people)?
22,"The military has been deployed in Barranquilla.

25,"I've got a weird question, don't misinterpret it, but *who* are taking part in the protests, apart from the common people? Because I've heard that there are guerrillas and criminal groups who are taking part. And also, do the protests have any sort of political bias? Like, would you say there is any sort of political propaganda or goal to benefit another party/candidate? Because that's really commonplace in our protests here."
26,I thought the protests were mostly over already since Duque is withdrawing the tax reforms?
27,Is this going to be a Arab Spring but for Latinamerica
28,Silver spoon fed posh Colombian children rooting for socialism but against social spending? Is this Opposite Day?
29,"The protests went down because of sheer misinformation. Taxes will cover the income from the pandemic (yes there is a loan designed for income) and corporations would take the bullet in any case. People are used to punch each others balls, when in fact security and income are doing great."
30,"Iván Duque’s tax reform was sorely needed. His government needs more revenue. 

But that’s a language that Petro supporters do not speak, and that the people whom like to protest Uribe’s successor do not speak either.

Edit: bunch of petristas below"
31,[I've found this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOezl-mZJS0) that explains most stuff. Thought?
32,You are no longer vacationing in iqaqaland anymore??? What happened???
33,"Colombia is a NARCO-STATE, since 2001 the government sells CoCaine to the Sinaloa's cartel, which are move by daily flights from ""El Dorado"" Airport, the armed forces cover it and that is why they attack the population who already realized it!

Do not trust the lies Colombian government tells, the heads of the armed forces receive annual bonuses of many millions of Colombian money, for their loyalty. Ask for the payrolls of these generals!!

The prosecution, the CTI and the military criminal justice are infiltrated by paramilitary groups and therefore it DOES NOT work and nothing will be clarified !!"

37,Hey colombians why don't you call the muricans?. The love fighting for human rights and all that shit lol.
38,"Yep, the more violence the more people go out, the more clashes, the more violence, hasta que venga el ejercito y empiece a dispararle a la gente tipo tianamen sq. :/"
39,[removed]
40,"The police have been awful in many cases but the protesters are by no means ideal. They've created shortages, stopped all sort of transport, stopped work, stopped everything that the country needs to hold on during the economic crisis brought on by the pandemic. They're also extremely violent in many cases, just like the police."
41,"* Previously, people earning around 5 minimum wages a month would pay an earning tax (progressive, not flat) the reform proposed to extend the taxing into people earning around 2.7 minimum wages a month.
* The current VAT is of 16%, the reform proposed to hike it to 19% and also proposed to tax more consumption goods and services. Some low earning people would be eligible to VAT refunding.
* The reform proposed taxing pensions amounting to 4.9 monthly minimum wages.
* People earning from 11 minimum wages a month would also pay a ""solidarity tax""

Also there were some reforms and hikes to earnings from stock trading among others."
42,"Te problem is that there are also a health reform, a labour reform, a pension reform .

They are all terrible, making people subject to exploitation and taking health rights from them.

In summary these all make people much more poor while still taking more money from them.

In contrast all of this could be avoided if these bastards did their job and went after the corrupt politicians that have been pillaging our country since our independence."
43,"Mr Duque’s reform was sorely needed. His government needs more revenue. Because of the pandemic, Colombia’s deficit has tripled to nearly 8% of GDP. Public debt could reach 108% of GDP in ten years. The reform would have removed many VAT exemptions and reduced the threshold for starting to pay income tax, from which revenues are among the lowest, as a share of GDP, in the OECD, a club of mostly rich countries. Pensions would have been taxed, too. Spending on social programmes would have increased, potentially benefiting 19m people. Mr Carrasquilla claimed the bill could have reduced the share of Colombians who are extremely poor (anyone who earns less than 145,004 pesos a month, or $38) by six percentage points.

Most Colombians, however, saw it as unfair. One of the longest lockdowns in the world has emptied wallets and sapped morale. Since last year 2.8m people have fallen into extreme poverty. More than 500,000 businesses have closed. Even though the tax increases would have hit the wealthiest hardest, many feel that it is not the right time to raise taxes. Fully 80% opposed the bill.

The repression of protests, however violent said protestors could be (these are several tens of thousands of protesters), has the opposite of the wanted reaction.

The bill was not the protesters’ only grievance. Colombians are frustrated, particularly with Mr Duque. The president promised to make the country safer. But violence is getting worse. Colombia is exporting record amounts of cocaine—it still provides around 70% of the world’s supply. Meanwhile illegal armed groups are growing stronger. Since 2016, the year a peace deal was signed with the FARC guerrillas, the remaining groups have driven a growing number of rural Colombians out of their homes and murdered hundreds of social leaders. Colombians, like many people elsewhere, also blame their government for mishandling the pandemic, which is rampaging through the country. Just 7% of the population have had a first jab of the vaccine."
44,"Hopefully there won't be the violence at least, we're closing in on 40 deaths, over 1000 injured, around 600 of them police officers, and worst of all around 90 missing persons.

We also have elections next year, it going to be such a mess 🙃"
45,"The deficit situation in El Salvador is becoming critical too, I fear our country might collapse in the next 10 years."
46,People were protesting against an incoming tax reform and it has devolved into a protest (and riots) against the current government as police and military repression keeps escalating.
47,"At this point who knows how everything will turn out. It feels bleak, but I guess you could say there's a little glimmer of hope in the fact that people are finally standing up to the government.

There's probably a lot of tension in most families right now. It's not uncommon for older people to say shit in favor of the government or the police and ESMAD (anti riot assholes), so naturally, people are mad at that kind of stuff. In my case, I don't really talk about these topics with my parents, because I know how they think."
48,"definitely will not escalate much, on social networks the whole thing appears much bigger than what it is (because of the very nature of social networks),  but in reality there isn't that many people in the streets, even, and a good part of the people in the street in the past three days or so belong to some kind of union or collective, who seek an opportunity to demand very concrete things (cab drivers protesting against Uber-like platforms; truck drivers protesting against paytolls, etc)."
49,"The overwhelming majority of demonstrators profess sympathies for left wing policies, most of them are soc-dems but there are also socialists and even marxists. They've being demonstrating almost continuously since 2018.

Next year Colombia will have presidential elections so I think they won't stop the ""trend"" they started in 2018 in order to prop up at least one of the many presidential candidates they will have."
50,Honestly I haven’t seen to many protests and stuff though I’m seeing it on the news and it’s kinda bleak
51,It would be the second tax hike in 4-5 years
52,Brazilians are probably feeling the same (even if the math doesn't work out)
53,"It's a term that implies that all of this social movements in Latin America have the objective to destroy the region and goverments to "" spread comunism"" that are without clearly leaders.

Basically it's a conspiracy theory that was created by a Chilean Neo Nazi and supported by far-right politicians all over the region.

[This article](https://m.lasillavacia.com/revolucion-molecular-disipada-invento-neonazi-estudiada-fuerza-publica-81359) from La Silla Vacía is really helpful."
54,I just saw a comment in world news about this and it is a chilean guy spewing crypto-fascist propaganda
55,"Yeah, basically this. The protests stopped being about only the reform a long time ago."
56,"agreed with some things, disagree with others.

we are not from rich families, at least I am from a lower middle class family in a small city.

corruption is not just some rich people and high profile politicians stealing money, it has much, much deeper roots. And it's much more complex than just people taking off money from your pocket.

Colombians are not taxed, very few people pays taxes. This is a fact, scholars and economists would say you so. To use road tolls as an example of people paying taxes is silly, most Colombians don't own a car, even middle class Colombians. Most Colombians don't even have formal jobs, and informal economy doesn't pay taxes.

Gilberto Tobón is a pretty bad analyst, he's just a youtube influencer, with political interests and his speech is extremely simplistic. He's not an expert on these subjects."
57,This needs more upvotes.
58,"I checked and the source tells that it's around 10%

The tax reform proposed a hike of it to 17%"
59,"Yeah it was part of the proposal and people still went against it. The people who say this reform was in favor of the rich somehow overlooked the massive spikes in Capital gains tax, progressive income tax reform, social income for poor, And taxes on high pensions, also at progressive rates.

The reform was a brilliant step to reduce inequality and deficits in one of the most unequal countries in the region, and just because an unpopular president tried it we have this backlash."
60,I think they tossed in a wealth tax. Will be honest I love Colombia (and still want to visit) but in terms of having it as a future home base kind of faded out of my mind. Still might get a vacation place there as it is pretty nice.
61,Protests are happening in different cities. The situation in Cali has been the most complicated one.
62,"Cali is one of the most dangerous cities in the World. Sadly, violence it's pretty common there..."
63,"Didn't most people disagree with a peace treaty with FARC and the government just went ahead and did it anyway and like, gave them seats in the senate, land and other benefits? AFAIK we're talking about a guerrilla that's responsible for hundreds of terrorist attacks who are now recognized as a political party."
64,"Yeah, people act like police brutality is fine as long as it isn't being ordered from a socialist or whatever."
65,"do you know under which circumstances these people got killed, and by whom?"
66,wait those things are NOT taxed in your country?
67,But that tax on basic groceries are on the existing one or is a brand new over nothing? Because for example here in Chile we pay 19% on everything we pay to collect taxes
68,">and install urban tolls, i.e. within a city, you would have to pay fees in order to circulate.

What in the flying fuck?"
69,">BUT they want to tax very basic products like coffee, eggs, milk

no, that was taken down from the reform text in the very first days, like a week before the street protests started."
70,By how much things will get more expensive?
71,"For what I understand, there was an attemted tax reform, that was very poorly implemented and would affect the poor a lot at a time unemployment is high, and allthough most people agree its necesary to have such reforms, they dislike how corrupt the government is, and how little of those taxes benefit the common people. So the protests begun, and they escalated quickly, some protestors and police have died, mostly the former, which has angered people even more"
72,">or is it like Portland Oregon where the protests are only 1-2 city blocks?

yes, and some road blocks."
73,"It's very unlikely. A lot of social/political actors would have to converge for that to happen as long as the military falls into line with the status quo there is no immediate pressure for him.

Centro Democratico keeps silently distancing from him. At the very least politically he's done after his term."
74,There is no re-election so it would be kind of pointless
75,No he has friends in high places
76,"definitely not, not a chance."
77,"Mr Duque is weak politically—unlike his predecessors, he does not have a stable majority coalition in Congress. Even his mentor, former president Alvaro Uribe, has distanced himself from Mr Duque; he was one of the first to speak against the bill. The president has surrounded himself with yes-men, which helps explain why he seems out of touch with many Colombians. Indeed, since the protests started he has given the impression that he hadn’t even read the bill. He seemed surprised to learn about some of its VAT measures and left Mr Carrasquilla and another minister to defend the reform.

Governing will become even harder for Mr Duque. His term ends in August 2022 and he is already seen as a lame duck. Opposition politicians feel emboldened. Gustavo Petro, a left-winger, is gaining momentum in the polls. He lost against Mr Duque in the presidential elections of 2018, but is planning to run again next year. He has proposed that the central bank print more money to deal with the aftermath of the pandemic, and has praised the late Hugo Chávez, the despotic socialist who set Venezuela on the path to ruin. Instead of a bold tax reform, Mr Duque’s legacy may instead be ensuring that Colombia gets its first socialist president."
78,[deleted]
79,"It would be pointless, next in line if Duque were to resign are his VP, Marta Lucía Ramírez (who is absolutely fucking useless) and President of the Congress (Arturo Char) who might be an even bigger crook than Duque (Google the Char family). No real change would be seen in that department with the current scenario 

And, even if we, somehow, managed to prop up a Mujica-Merkel-FDR-Mandela hybrid (you get the idea) as president, we'd still have the same crooked, rotten congress who would absolutely pull out all the stops whenever said president wanted to do something that doesn't benefit them

And, as someone a couple comments further down said, the economic consequences for the country would be massive were Duque to step down. Even if he's a shit president (IMO he makes a rather strong case for worst president in our history), investors and international markets would rather have him there than have a ""headless"" state borrowing money and shit."
80,"That's their aim right now, without asking themselves about how much it will affect Colombia's fundamentals (credit rating, sovereign debt rates, CDS points, currency exchange rate, inflation rate, ...)

Being foreign to economics/finance concepts doesn't make anyone immune to them, but Colombians tend to think that ignoring/overlooking concepts grants a pass from them."
81,Oh this is messed up!
82,I fear that too. I am sorry.
83,I also expect this to boost Petro's popularity
84,"Both political sides agree tax reform is necessary. 

An alternative Petro suggested was printing more money."
85,"It's necessary, the issue is the distribution of the taxation and the exemptions that don't disappear."
86,"El alcalde influencer joven y chévere salió igualito a los demás políticos, ¿quién lo diría?"
87,"There's  a ""Comite del Paro"" who is made up of several Unions and usually they are the ones who call for paros in Colombia, when this started as a protest for the tax reform they were the ones who called for it.

This paro has been different. Much more people have gone to the streets than before and the escalation and violence in the cities has been unprecedented in many ways, especially in Cali. In a sense it's ""new ground"" for Colombia as far protesting go.

As the days have passed  and the protesta have taken a new form beyond the tax reform, there's s huge gap between the original comite del Paro and the people protesting. Simply put if they said ""The paro is over"" Most people on the streets would continue. It's a big problem right now.

The government's usual scapegoat is to say there's ""infiltrados"" from the guerrillas. Always is. Could they be? Maybe. Are they the ones leading the protests and are they a big majority? I don't think so. 

As for political bias. Clearly it's people who are tired of Duque and are antiuribistas. That is true. Like you are saying many people are accusing left wing candidates like Petro of being instigators and using the protest for personal gain. Maybe he will. But at this stage most people really are not thinking about Petro when they are going out there. If Petro said today ""we have to stop"". People wouldn't stop either."
88,"From a distance, it looks like it has transitioned to opposition against the brutality that the tax protesters suffered. I have read there are calls to disband the anti-riot squads responsible for the deaths, and general calls for government officials to resign."
89,"What u/boneyfingers said. But also there are other incoming reforms like healthcare, labour and pension reform.

Just read 2 days ago an academic analysis of the proposed healthcare reform is a clusterfuck. It will make the current healthcare system more akin to the US."
90,"They're far from over, showcasing the real scope of things."
91,"Perhaps, poor countries cannot afford coronavirus lockdowns, so here are the consequences. More political disarray in the third world."
92,"A couple years ago more countries protested, so no i doubt it"
93,"May God spare us from another of those ""revolutions"""
94,"Taking into account what Arab Spring brought forth, please no."
95,"No, I don't think so."
96,The Colombian left trying to strike another Chile. At least Chile had its finances and institutions in a better shape. This mob will end up ruling over debris.
97,"""Petro supporters""

This narrative NEEDS to stop. This went beyond elections a long time ago. Petro or not, tax reform or not. People are tired of Duque. That's undeniable, Petro is the last thing on the minds of the people on the streets."
98,Tax Reform was indeed needed. No one is denying that. The Problem is the way he and his government are trying to execute it. Its blatantly disorganized. They definately didn't think this thought as they glossed over  the possible out comes of such a high and drastic tax reform and how it could lead to bigger issues.
99,"After cutting taxes for the richest people in the last tax reform. I dislike Petro a lot but that ""guerrillero mamerto"" attitude towards anything to the left of extreme right is dumb and propagandistic."
100,"Why the fuck is it that people keep blaming the left and Petro for everything wrong with the country but those in power and that are governing ya, and that have been in power for as long as I can remember, are all from the far-right? Can you explain this please?"
101,"Usually we agree, this time we don't.

No, the tax reform wasn't needed. What Colombia (and most of Latin America) needs is a massive and drastic reduction of public spending.

Then, and only then, the tax systems could be reviewed.

It's time to stop feeding useless bureaucrats."
102,"Sorely needed by whom? the reform was an absolute disaster, that would defund the arts.

I'm not like a super good economist, but in a moment like this you want to reduce taxes and increase spending in projects that puts more money in people's hands. The tax reform was a tool of opression, not revenue."
103,"Yup, I wonder what the reaction would have been if instead the government didn't bother to do anything against the pandemic and our hospitals had run out of supplies, also I can imagine the outrage if we hadn't bought any  vaccines by now. People just don't seem to understand we're a poor country, and that means we're going to have a hard time funding the response to an emergency as big as this one."
104,"That tax reform was so aligned with wealth redistribution that lefties went mad to the idea of not being them doing the reform; and politicians (some of them soon-to-be retirees) went mad to the idea of them paying more taxes.

Duque tried to do a Bismarck without a Prussian army."
105,"Duque Macri y Piñera son socialdemócratas?

112,"I get you. Our president said that the fault of the second wave  lies (this time) in doctors because they... did their job and treated other illness. At the time people defended CFK when she said basically that diabetics are wealthy fatties.

123,">They are all terrible 

why? explain us, please.

but it pressume it would be hard to explain for you something that doesn't exist. There isn't any pension reform formulated, nor there is any labour reform. And the healthcare ""reform"" is the application of several laws already approved.

but explain your points of view."
124,"I am a bit out of the loop, but compared to even their neighbors Colombia's labor market seems liberal (perhaps there are things I am unaware of that can be improved but it seems decent as is). On pension reform it seems like outside Chilean type privatization, I don't see how that can be liberalized anymore as it is a market based plan. On healthcare I am out of the loop. From the little I gathered it reminds me of the HMO act in the US that was more than useless. Again I am not on the ground but that is what I can gather, correct me if I am wrong."

126,">One of the longest lockdowns in the world has emptied wallets and sapped morale. Since last year 2.8m people have fallen into extreme poverty. More than 500,000 businesses have closed.

I've been against lockdowns for one year exactly for this very same reason. I knew the economic consequences would be terrible, especially for poor countries. I was called names and people (on this very same subreddit) made fun of me.

Now we see the consequences.

The economy cannot just be shut down. It can't. Even after natural disasters the first thing people do is to try to get the systems back so people can work. People need to produce and the cash flow cannot be interrupted. Lockdowns are something so absurd that not even the craziest economic theories propose something like that.

History will be written and lockdowns will be described as what they really were: one of the biggest economic mistakes in history."

131,"Tell me about it. One of my uncles shared an article about the dissipated molecular revolution theory going around in the family group chat and all of my cousins had a few choice words which caused a family fight in the group chat lol, and my dad and I got into a small discussion yesterday because he supports the government and always tried to find a reason to defend them. It blows my mind."
132,"I don't know Josue. I agree that social networks usually make things appear bigger, nevertheless, I have to say that there is enough material to say that this is a big moment. Regarding your comment that there isn't many people in the streets and that a good part of them belong to unions, I disagree. What I've seen, been a witness myself, is that more than half is regular people, simply protesting for what they believe it is wrong with our country (whatever that is). Many people are protesting because of this frustration, the anger against a government who has not performed its duties well. I don't know where you stand in the situation, but I believe things might escalate even more, both in protests and in politics. 
In protests: Police brutality will continue and people will continue protesting. We are sick of the way police behaves in this country. How many people will protest? I don't know. Initially I thought that considering the risk you take when you protest with the police + covid less people would be willing to do it. What I've seen is many people going out and protest, considering the risk, because they believe the moment requires it. 
Politics. This is a very complicated one. I'll just say that multiple people are trying to take advantage of the situation. Many governors and mayors have shown their true face. It has been clear the executive branch has no control over police or military unless their interests are aligned. Whatever happens politically might not be the best option possible, but I don't see things changing (for better or worse) any other way."

135,"I don't remember the last year where we did not have a tax hike tbh but that's on us, if you guys disagree with the tax hike you are probably right"
136,">Colombians are not taxed, very few people pays taxes.

Nearly every Colombian pays taxes in some form of other. Do you buy beer? Aguardiente? You pay a tax for it. Buy anything outside certain kinds of food? Most of that is taxed with a 19% Value-Added-Tax or VAT, also known as the. IVA.

Do you eat at a restaurant or buy bread at a bakery (you wouldn't be a real proper Colombian if you didn't do the later) you pay a 8% consumption tax.

Do you have cell-phone or internet service? There is another consumption tax on that of 8%.

Not to mention the taxes on any money you transfer via bank, cuatro por mil? Ever heard of it? You pay 4 pesos for every 1000 pesos on any kind of financial transaction. This tax was passed in 1998 and supposed to be temporary, but they kept it around forever because congress knows that there's nothing like a good tax. Over time most Colombians have been made exempt from this tax, but most businesses still have to pay it. And since it's a tax on financial transactions that tax can filter down to you.

And then we approach taxes paid by people who are officially employed. Yes, only about 50% of people have official jobs in Colombia, and that number is now way less since the pandemic did away with a bunch of them, but 50% of a country is still a lot of people. These are your typical ""payroll taxes"" as we understand them in the US. Those are broken down into two categories for individuals (and more for businesses but we can look at that later) which are healthcare and pension and equal 4% each which means official employees pay a 8% tax on their income. Healthcare is actually not a bad deal because that covers your health insurance, although EPS's are a useless nightmare a lot of the time, it's still a tax payment though. Pensions on the other hand require a ridiculous amount of weeks (1300 or 25 years of non-stop work compared to the US's 10)  to pay into to get benefits which is why nearly 80% of people who have official jobs, never actually qualify for pensions. Pensions as structured in Colombia are useless and for 80% of people that tax is a waste. Pensions exist for the rich and the pension tax is a regressive tax moving money away from poor people to the rich. That's why Pensions in Colombia have ridiculously high payouts.

Then we could get into the fact that there are [another 25% of taxes on income that employers have to pay](https://papayaglobal.com/countrypedia/country/colombia/?utm_term=&utm_campaign=US-Search-DSA-Countrypedia-DesktopAndMobile-M2F&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_acc=9309967209&hsa_cam=12441225283&hsa_grp=119172009780&hsa_ad=501571274138&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=dsa-1186009938853&hsa_kw=&hsa_mt=b&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gclid=Cj0KCQjwp86EBhD7ARIsAFkgakg81Q1RmQS0jC1Vh-fvyjibyiVGS_2FF2zX7Pmsd3UzMohzd6JId4EaAjpeEALw_wcB). Some of these are very important, medical tax, cesantias (factored as labour risk on the sheet) being funds that go into an account you can access if you are fired, and family compensation funds. But once again that 12% going into pensions is useless for most people with how the system is set up. And while all these benefits are extremely important, the high amount of taxes that need to be paid by companies do depress wages.

And that's just some of the taxes that most Colombians do end up paying. We're not even broaching issues like gas taxes (how do you think food gets to your local grocery anyways?), or property taxes (a good amount of Colombians do own homes naturally it's a minority, but those folks do have to pay something naturally), or the other multitude of taxes that exist in thee country.

While yes, most Colombians do not pay income taxes, they do pay some kind of tax somewhere at some point. And given how little most of them make, the amount they do pay can be quite significant.

&#x200B;

> To use road tolls as an example of people paying taxes is silly, most Colombians don't own a car, even middle class Colombians.

Do you buy goods that have ever been transported from one city to another?  Use public transport to travel between two cities? You've spent quite a bit of money on a tolls at that point in time, even though you don't seem to realize it. There's even a toll road between Cali and the airport at Palmira, for example, so if you ever got to fly out of Cali, you'll be paying into that toll.

[The road to the Llanos from Bogota is a famous example. It's controlled by Colombia's richest ogliarch.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZnQKTRFeJc) Most of the food that comes into Bogota comes from this region as does a lot of the petroleum and other important goods. The entire set up costs Colombian's millions of our national taxes to build, and we pay ridiculous fees on it to further pad the pocket of Carlos Sarmiento, while the costs of goods only go up due to his greed. Colombian's can't afford higher food costs because a billionaire wants to get richer.

As for your qualification that most Colombians don't own a car, that is true, but the concept that most middle class Colombians don't own one, just factually isn't true. It only makes sense if your qualification for what a middle class Colombian is is very, very low and doesn't include Taxi-Drivers, Truck Drivers of the multitudes of people who drive people around on Uber and InDriver or informal ""pirate"" transportation such as seen around the portal to the sea in Cali, for example.

Let's get into the nitty gritty, [Colombia's qualifier (per the DANE, the official statistics entity of the Colombian government) for ""Middle Class"" is income between $653,781($180) and $3,500,000 ($972) pesos a month.](https://forbes.co/2021/05/06/economia-y-finanzas/personas-con-ingresos-entre-653-781-y-35-millones-al-mes-son-clase-media/) Take into account the Colombian minimum wage is $908,526 ($250). So yes, according to the Government, people making less than minimum wage in Colombia are ""Middle Class""

Let me try to unpack how absurd that notion is. You can not fucking live on 650 thousand pesos a month in Colombia. In most cities you can not even pay rent with 650 thousand pesos a month in Colombia. No one who makes that much money in Colombia qualifies as any kind of middle class. This just further demonstrates how out of touch this entire administration is with reality. Maybe this has something to do with [this gomelo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmqo94UsKqw) being Duque's head of the DANE (ey marica).

But if you earn over 2 million pesos a month, you can quite possibly afford a car in Colombia. I know people who earn a bit over 1 million who own cars. You must keep in mind that cars in Colombia are an investment used to generate income and act as something that allows class mobility and higher incomes. Effectively just owning a car allows one access to the middle class. For me it's almost difficult too qualify someone as middle class without some level of car ownership.

So yeah, while many Colombians do not own car, the fact that the Colombian vision of middle class is this fucking poor points to the massive levels of inequality and poverty in the country that have only been worsened by Neoliberal vultures and out of touch Ogliarchs like Duque and Santos.

&#x200B;

>corruption is not just some rich people and high profile politicians stealing money, it has much, much deeper roots. And it's much more complex than just people taking off money from your pocket.

Sure it does, but the corruption that hurts the Colombian people the most is this corruption and it is all interconnected culturally with all forms of other corruption. People learn from their role models. And the actions leadership takes reverberates through society.

&#x200B;

>Gilberto Tobón is a pretty bad analyst, he's just a youtube influencer, with political interests and his speech is extremely simplistic. He's not an expert on these subjects.

Who would you qualify as a good analyst on Colombian politics then? Tobon barely has a youtube following. If anything he's a facebook influencer, but he's more of a television journalist. Not an actual youtube influencer like Pewdiepie."
137,"I don't think people were opposing that. The problem was with how far reaching it was and how it would affect the already struggling middle and lower class.

143,"Misinformation, nothing more."
144,"If you had something that $2000 right now, it will cost 20% more: $2500. Let's say milk for the whole week: $12 000, now it will cost:.     $14 400. 

So that's for milk only, but if you want to buy any other milk based product it's price will rice accordingly. All basic products of consumption would get taxed, except for: sugary products. Why? Because many landowners from the Cauca Valley (the worst of the worst) depend on sugar cane production. Many big Colombian enterprises produce things like fizzy drinks, lollies, etc. That won't get taxed, but eggs, milk, coffee, chocolate, etc. will be taxed.

Petrol will also be more expensive too. So everything that has to be transported, will be more expensive.

Whether if it gets more expensive or not depends on what products have VAT already and what products don't. Some only have a VAT of 5%, but that will change with this reform.

This is thanks to an economic policy of extractivism that only relies on commodities to sustain it's whole economy. The government doesn't mind if the COP gets cheaper and cheaper, because we can export cheap oil overseas, but they won't invest in education or the peasantry. That combined with the rising violence in the outback... Well... It seems the government only cares about keeping its profit going and that is the profit of landowners and politicians. We live in a feudal system ruled by physiochrats."

If they want to change the country, be reasonable, and not ask for less taxes and more subsidies. Colombia has no money, and we're getting more and more in debt. The dollar is skyrocketing. Cities are having food shortages, hundreds of millions of pesos are being lost every hour in people not working and blockades around the country. Duque has to scramble the military, as the people have destroyed way too much, and if there is no intervention from the military now, it may be too late until the country is unrepairable. A protest is just a day and sends a clear and concise message, this is becoming young people requesting outrageous demands, and using this as a way to skip off their responsabilities, as the amount of damage they are doing by protesting are making their demands even harder to put into order, as the government has to restore our country before doing anything else. You don't ""fix"" a country by destroying its public transport, or its Capitol, or hundred's of entrepenours bussiness. Shown exactly to perfection yesterday when Transmilenio was skipping tens of stations vandalized and destroyed by the same protestors a few days ago. And then they blame the government.

Por el otro lado su partido ha sido el artífice de cosas como la ley de alquileres que aumentó los impuestos y congeló precios para los que alquilan y al final salió como el orto porque los precios de los alquileres subieron y se cagaron los inquilinos y los propietarios. También han presentado otras leyes regulatorias y de índole socialdemócrata-socialista.

De nuevo, sobre Duque y Piñera no tengo idea, pero Macri no fue de centro-izquierda y la mayoría te dirían lo mismo. Después lo del M-19; según tengo entendido no existe hace 20 años esa guerrilla pero supongo que lo que critica es que el tipo haya estado en una guerrilla de índole terrorista y que sea un candidato presidencial, pero francamente esto es latinoamerica y acá en Argentina la mitad del gobierno actual fueron Montoneros, del ERP o de otro grupo guerrillero.

[http://leyes.senado.gov.co/proyectos/images/documentos/Textos%20Radicados/proyectos%20de%20ley/2020%20-%202021/PL%20010-20%20Derecho%20Fundamental%20a%20la%20Salud.pdf](http://leyes.senado.gov.co/proyectos/images/documentos/Textos%20Radicados/proyectos%20de%20ley/2020%20-%202021/PL%20010-20%20Derecho%20Fundamental%20a%20la%20Salud.pdf)

&#x200B;

I will point out some of the worst points:

**Capítulo 3, Artículo 11, Parágrafo 4** \-  . *The people must be responsible of following the instructions of ""autocare"" given by the ""AS"", be it through the medical personnel or through the health promotion guidelines. The people must be on time for appointments and adhere themselves to the recommendations of treatment and care*.

Nice! Isn't it? the problem is that behind this paragraph and many others they are putting a paywall, so if you for some reason are considered irresponsible by the AS (and such judgment will be left to the AS -what a stupid bullshit-) you will be charged more.

On the next paragraph you will see it. The biggest issue with this is that it will happen in the most unequal country of latin america and one of the most corrupt in the world. Now you should see that this is not something made to ecourage responsability, is just a way of making the poor more poor and giving more money to the EPS or AS.

**Capítulo 4, Artículo 16, Parágrafo 1** \- THIS ONE WAS MODIFIED, but originally provided more autonomy and power to the EPSs (AS), a terrible idea considering the CARTELS in contracts regarding supplies and other stuff.

&#x200B;

**Capítulo 4, Artículo 17** \- This is probably the worst, it is supposedly out of the discussion already but it is still showing in the official website of the senate so I will include it here. This article seeks for the depuration of the insurability given by the AS, which means that the Basic Plan of Healthcare will see the number of diseases and conditions covered by it reduced in God knows what and how much.

**Capítulo 4, Artículo 21, Parágrafo 2** \- Imposes new limitations to join the ""RS - or  subsidized regime"", specially for those that are unemployed (something that I find terrible if you take into account the effects of the pandemic in out economy). More people will be left without healthcare.

**Capítulo 5, Artículo 24** \- THIS ONE WAS MODIFIED, originally wanted to provide assistance only during the course of illness, something that doesn't make sense, since health is more of a matter of prevention. You don't want a healthcare system that only wants to cure or treat. (I am seriously surprised this was even considered).

Some of these had been modified but I put them here to show how cynic this government is.

&#x200B;

Now I could continue pointing out other elements regarding the health care workers, the distribution of ""residency quotas"", the practical medical training autonomy of the IPS, the liquidation of ESE or public hospitals and so on.

I believe this should be enough for now. At this point I can't imagine that you stated that there is almost nothing new, when they are literally flipping everything over. **There is not a single element of the Healthcare system not touched by this**, and you have the audacity to say it is ""something that already existed"".

I confess I don't know much of the pensional reform and the labour reform, but reading the health reform and the tributary reform, I BELIEVE there is a bigger chance for the others to exist than not.

EDIT: STILL CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DID NOT READ THE REFORM BY YOUR OWN. I didn't give you a link to the colombian medical academy analysis or to any other site that made summaries because I wanted to discuss it with you under our own udnerstanding (because you sounded like you did it by yourself) what a disappointment."
197,"How in the hell the supression of regimenes subsidiado and contributivo for them to be merged into only one regime is something that has been approved? when was it approved? what's the law number? 

&#x200B;

Also the ""autocuidado"" part, when was it approved? when did the law said that basically if EPS just go and say ""well yeah, you didnt take care of yourself so tough luck buddy we gonna charge you extra"" it can be actually legal and not a cause of, for example, an acción de tutela in order to exempt people for that?

&#x200B;

Explain it to me because I'm at a loss."
198,"Not true.

Combined with fiscal policy, lockdowns work extremely well. The whole reason is to avoid a collapse in a country's health system. 

No serious economist is going to undermine the severity of the economic consequences of a lockdown, which is why it should be coupled with a fiscal policy.

Unfortunately, Colombia wants to start an austerity measure, i.e raising taxes, in the middle of a recession, which is incredibly dangerous. 

Also, lockdowns are supposed to last 2-3 months. They concentrate the economic damage in those months, ameliorated with fiscal policy. Instead, the situation you have in many countries in South America is a haphazardly attempt of a lockdown, combined with a lackluster spending by government authorities. This creates a situation in which the economic damage of the pandemic is spread over the whole year while poverty ensues. 

It is true many countries in South America had already structural problems, particulary after 2014. We, as a group of countries, are still moving, and suffering, from policies such as austerity measures as a solution to a recession. 

Also, if you think 100% of the economic problems in the ongoing recession, with the official start date of March 2020, is exclusively because of the pandemic, you are wrong."

201,"If I'm being honest, I really don't know. There's so much uncertainty that I believe anything could happen. I think the possibility that it gets way worse exists, as I know the things this government's capable of, but I really can't predict what will happen."
202,"well, at least that's the situation in my hometown, cab drivers and truck drivers blocking roads. and I live in a fairly left leaning city, hometown of Gustavo Petro. It was one of the few municipalities in Central Eastern Colombia where Petro got more votes than Duque.

Ironically I had to go to the first day of protests, and all I saw there was teenagers and union workers, very few people over 22 y.o.

From what I gather from the news, the situation in Bogota now is the same, road blockades from ""transportadores y camioneros"", concentrated in a few strategic spots. 

so, some people are angsty and frustrated... so? Everyone is, for many different reasons. Uribistas can be angry and frustrated too, they can take the streets too and there are millions of them. Who will we obey? the ones who shout the loudest? the ones who make the most noise? I don't think it's about that. It's not about some people in the street with their false righteousness shouting that Duque is a pig and everyone who doesn't think like they do are ""paracos"". It has to be about arguments, it has to be about reaching some kind of collective agreements, based on respecting each other's way of thinking. But that is far from what is currently happening."
203,"Not in the whole city, tonight it was just 300 hundred people or so marching in the city center. Pretty much all of them were aged 15-22. Very little for a city of 150k people. And even considering this town tends to be much more left leaning than many others in Colombia. Gustavo Petro grew up here and lived here until he was 30 or so."
204,Yes.
205,"The problem with Colombia is that these tax hikes needed to happen for everyone, but they only happened for people (low-mid-high classes), not for top companies. And that the measures do not fix structural issues in the society.

Let me illustrate with an example: Former minister Carrasquilla, who quitted yesterday, goes on media saying this:

https://www.semana.com/economia/macroeconomia/articulo/colombia-tiene-caja-para-seis-o-siete-semanas-alberto-carrasquilla/202152/

We need about COP 30 trillions. Now check this:

http://www.elnuevodia.com.co/nuevodia/opinion/columnistas/dario-ortiz/465200-ali-baba-y-los-40-billones

COP 50-90 trillions lost per year due to corruption.But the solution is to tax people more. A few days later this year, the government announces:

https://www.elquindiano.com/noticia/26201/reforma-tributaria-para-financiar-la-guerra

$14 trillion to buy air superiority fighters from the US. But we still need $30 trillion because there is reputedly no money."

207,At this point they could be protesting as wealth tax and you guys would still support it

Maybe it's not THAT prominent in social media (eg. Instagram) as it is mostly populated by younger people (who mostly tend to be against police brutality and/or the current government)

But if you were to go into Facebook (which has a bit of a reputation as an ""old people"" social network) or WhatsApp group chats for example, you'll find plenty of people justifying the government and the killing of demonstrators, reducing all of them to mere vandals/criminals (which isn't the case obviously)"
211,"every death so far has been under different circumstances, check the news and the reports from Defensoría del Pueblo, HRW and other organizations.

No, again, this was not in the reform text. It was taken down."
215,">If you had something that $2000 right now, it will cost 20% more: $2500. Let's say milk for the whole week: $12 000, now it will cost:.     $14 400.

again, no. Not only because of what mauricio replied, but because the reform project didn't increase VAT from 16 to 19% as many people still claim, that was taken away from the text very early in the discussion.

something you describe would skyrocket inflation, would reduce a lot purchasing power of people and make consumption collapse... what you say doesn't even make sense. No goverment would shoot its foot that way (at least in the terms you described it)."
216,"You're misled.

That product costing $2000 already has a 19% VAT added to it.

Hiking the VAT to 20% will imply a recalculation:

After 19% VAT: $2000 --> Before 19% VAT: $1680,67 --> After 20% VAT: $2016,81

Seriously, this country is so stupid and sectarian. Haven't seen any informed, intelligent discussion about this reform so far."
228,It's because they need people like Petro to be the enemy because if he's not everything bad they say he is people will realize it's been them all along.
229,"Please read, I'm saying this is beyond taxes too. People are tired."

235,">We aren’t a poor country though. We are an upper middle-income country.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal%29_per_capita?wprov=sfla1

That is very low for a country of over 50 million people, Bill Gates alone is worth more than that. 

We need over a 100 million vaccines (2 for each person), [10 million](https://www.semana.com/economia/articulo/cuanto-gastara-colombia-en-la-vacuna-contra-el-coronavirus/308682/) units of the Pfizer vaccine (the cheapest one, I believe) cost 113,664,945 USD, so the total cost, assuming all the vaccines we acquire are from Pfizer, will amount to around 1,136,649,450 USD or ~1.4% of the government's budget just to buy vaccines, then you have to take into account the cost of the medical supplies needed to deal with this emergency (siringes, oxygen tanks, etc.) and the cost of safe transport and storage for those vaccines.

This pandemic is going to be quite expensive to deal with, and Colombia, as a poor country, is going to struggle big time to pay for all of this."
236,"There was also a VAT refund system within the original tax reform proposal; political agitators conveniently overlooked that.

I'm far from progressive or adept to permanent redistribution of wealth; but the ongoing COVID crisis demands that. What baffles me is that it's the so called ""progressives"" the ones opposing it and that's why I think that their problem is nothing short of not being them taking the awards from the implementation of such redistribution system.

That's why you, me and others receive downvotes, insults and not a single valid criticism of the tax reform project."
237,"Pues Petro se desmovilizó en un proceso de paz auspiciado por el gobierno colombiano de entonces. No debería importar. A Petro se lo recalcan porque es una forma fácil de atacarlo.

245,"Yeah, I was just commenting based on what he was saying. But, nonetheless, lowering the value of exemption from the income tax during a pandemic makes it look bad.

I understand why it happens, because the same happens in Brazil: there are too many poor people and too few rich people, so if you try to only increase taxes on the rich it's not enough. But to try to push something like this with everything that is going seems like a bad move."
246,Refunds are a hell of a lot more obstructive for lower class people than exemption would be.

>from policies such as austerity measures as a solution to a recession. 

Why do Latin Americans always have to paint austerity as a bad word? Are we so used to spending without control that the thought of spending within our means is crazy?

Excessive public spending is neither healthy nor wise. I recognize cutting down public spending in a recession is not orthodox, but when do we start? Maybe it's the time for shock therapy.

>Combined with fiscal policy

Fiscal policy meaning debt and money printing? I'd rather not devalue my currency or get into more debt.

Agree. That could actually have the opposite effect."

A civil war clearly and violently divides a society but guess what? You or me could be riding a bus with a person we consider far opposite from our points of view yet we do not draw guns at each other. In a civil war we wouldn't even have a bus ride.

259,"yes, I agree with you. The way you said is the way is has to be, but it is also far from what is happening now. Hate, anger and frustration are being more important than arguments. This is at least the case for most people in the country, protesting or not. I'm personally guilty of the same thing. I'm trying to do better. 

I just want to add to anyone reading this who is not from Colombia that we have an additional problem here: lack of trust for one another. Even if we agree on certain things or in everything, we are always skeptical of the other part. Why? Sadly, our culture and history both as a country and as a society has been written by people who take advantage of their position. Sometimes is money, sometimes power, sometimes lives. 

I sincerely hope that some day we can change this attitude. It will take years, but we might get there. My only hope is to learn about countries that were and are able to change themselves. Most recently, I learned about South Africa. You can learn more here: https://www.dianauribe.fm/cronicas-de-viajes/viajeasudafricaii . You can also learn about Ruanda.

One of those, Russia, literally violated our airspace with fighter bombers like a week ago, at the same time the Venezuelan minister of defense said any war would be fought in Colombian territory. Is it really so ridiculous for us to buy a couple of planes? When Taïwan said they were buying fighters from the US everyone here was in favor."

They very much are. In fact, I'm sorry for this but living in LATAM altogether is pretty depressing now.

Las EPS solo se pueden quedar con el 10% de la UPC para gastos administrativos o ingresos empresariales y el resto tiene que ir al pago de los servicios de sus afiliados. Eso no lo están haciendo así, nunca lo han hecho así, solo citemos el caso Saludcoop como ejemplo”.

Pero ellas dicen ‘¡ah! Si usted me va a tratar como aseguradora y me va a poner un porcentaje de administración y el resto para servicios, entonces yo no le jalo.

>  
>En efecto, en el artículo 22 del proyecto se precisa que “el Ministerio de Salud y Protección Social definirá el porcentaje de la prima de aseguramiento que podrá ser usada en gastos de administración, basado en criterios de eficiencia, estudios actuariales, financieros y criterios técnicos, así como los conceptos que conforman dicho gasto. Este porcentaje no podrá superar el 8% de la prima de aseguramiento”.    
>  
>Entonces, el término “prima de aseguramiento” genera confusión y resistencia entre la comunidad médica opuesta al proyecto por las implicaciones que esta podría tener en la práctica. “Al artículo \[22\] se le tiene que mejorar la redacción porque confunde un concepto que es la Unidad de Pago por Capitación con otro concepto que es la prima de aseguramiento. Ahí no puede haber ninguna duda”, expuso el director general de la Asociación Colombiana de Hospitales y Clínicas, ACHC, Juan Carlos Giraldo, en una [intervención](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47s6MmLhxBE) ante el Congreso a principios de noviembre.

>De hecho, [Marcela Vélez](https://scienti.minciencias.gov.co/cvlac/visualizador/generarCurriculoCv.do?cod_rh=0001385569), doctora en Políticas de Salud y profesora del Instituto de Investigaciones Médicas de la Universidad de Antioquia, nos explicó la cuestión en estas palabras:   
>  
>“El proyecto de ley cambia el nombre de las EPS, pero no está cambiando la estructura de cómo funcionan en este momento. Lo que tiene Colombia es un sistema de aseguramiento en salud que se financia con las contribuciones salariales. En el proyecto creo que todo eso sigue. No es como en Estados Unidos, por ejemplo, que la gente tiene que salir a comprar un seguro privado en salud, como se compra un seguro privado de carros o un seguro privado de casas. No es ese cambio el que se está dando”.   
>  
>Finalmente, hay que aclarar que el proyecto crea un Régimen Único de Salud, según el texto de la iniciativa, para poner fin a los regímenes Contributivo y Subsidiado. Pero para Vélez, eso no significa “que la gente de Régimen Subsidiado va a entrar a pagar al Régimen Único como pagan los que están en el Régimen Contributivo, sino que se quiere equiparar los beneficios”.   
>  
>Según nos explicó la médica, esto tampoco es nada nuevo “porque se supone que esa diferencia entre los regímenes en cuestiones de beneficios ya no existía legalmente desde la [Sentencia T 760 \[de 2008\]](https://consultorsalud.com/como-la-sentencia-t-760-2008-cambio-el-sistema-de-salud/#:~:text=La%20sentencia%20T%2D760%2C%20es,como%20un%20derecho%20fundamental%20aut%C3%B3nomo.)”. "
286,"Ive read the reform, not the pics everyone and their mom is sharing. 

And yeah, it doesn’t say anything about any of the things I told you about, which are definitely in the reform. The article is talking about REGIMENES ESPECIALES which is another bag of potatoes, and about curriculums and privatizations I never mentioned. So yeah, you have yet to tell me WHERE AND WHEN THE POINTS I TOUCHED WERE APPROVED."
287,"Oh my god, if I knew you did not even read the Senate law by yourself I would have not wanted my time writing such long comment in order to discuss it with you.

288,That happens in an ideal world where people respect the lockdowns...
289,"I am not painting austerity as a bad word. The problem is it is always used as a solution during recessions, which is incredibly dangerous.

Any sort of austerity, such as cut in public spending, raising taxes, reducing welfare benefits, is by its own nature, a contractionary fiscal policy. Which means it works as a way to reduce a country's GDP, which is precisely what you DO NOT want during a recession.

Also, there are a platitude of many economic papers claiming that trying to reduce the deficit or the public debt during a recession will only make things worse because it will contract the countries GDP and, as consequence, reduce tax revenue, worsening the public finance situation.

First thing here about ""debt and money printing"", this is a monetarist tenet, which is not something that is accepted very easily by most economists today, especially after 2008. The most you can say about ""money printing"" and the ensuing inflation is only on the long-run, which is over many years. I don't think many people will care about the long-run if your economy completely collapses in the short-run because you refuse to induce an expansionary fiscal policy.

Second, recessions will always raise the level of uncertainty in any country, which will always reduce the investment rate and increase unemployment, and it will go down on a spiral of collapses until government raises the bar through fiscal policy, offering a ""floor"" to fall upon.

Third, Latin American countries suffer from short-term inflation which is not caused by money printing, which is also another hot debate, because you can consider that the Central Bank does not even control the monetary base, it only controls the interest rate. The main problems in many inflationary processes are because of two things: a huge consumer demand of foreign goods and a volatile national currency.

Recession happens > investment rate reduces > unemployment raises > investment rate reduces again because of high unemployment > more people are laid off and unemployment raises again > and so on.

Fiscal policy can work as means to increase the investment rate, if a government start to build large infrastructure projects, this will raise the level of demand necessary for private enterprises to start hiring again and a recovery will ensue.

People have to stop thinking that public finance is the same as household finance."

It is, but there comes a point when sacrifices need to be made and a crisis is the perfect opportunity to make changes. It's time to stop this overspending we have.

>Also, there are a platitude of many economic papers claiming that trying to reduce the deficit or the public debt during a recession will only make things worse because it will contract the countries GDP and, as consequence, reduce tax revenue, worsening the public finance situation.

Obviously a reduction in public spending has to come with some other changes especially in commerce and trade. I recognize that bluntly reducing public spending can be tough (but necessary).

>First thing here about ""debt and money printing"", this is a monetarist tenet, which is not something that is accepted very easily by most economists today, especially after 2008. The most you can say about ""money printing"" and the ensuing inflation is only on the long-run, which is over many years. I don't think many people will care about the long-run if your economy completely collapses in the short-run because you refuse to induce a expansionary fiscal policy. 

I'm not offended when people call me monetarist. If wanting a solid and stable currency with minimal inflation makes me a monetarist, so be it. Inflation is a punishment for the working class. It's awful and being ""on the long-run"" doesn't make it any better.

>Third, Latin American countries suffer from short-term inflation which is not caused by money printing, which is also another hot debate, because you can consider that the Central Bank does not even control the monetary base, it only controls the interest rate. The main problems in many inflationary processes is because of two things: a huge consumer demand of foreign goods and a volatile national currency. 

I have identified three or four main causes of inflation. I partially agree with you that it's not always monetary, but it is one the main causes. Increases in basic costs, demand and currency exchange rates are also factors. However, this varies by country.

>Fiscal policy can work as means to increase the investment rate, if a government start to build large infrastructure projects, this will raise the level of demand necessary for private enterprises to start hiring again and a recovery will ensue. 

I live in a country where people always scream that the government must build infrastructure projects to ""move the economy"". This is such a Keynesian and short-sighted concept. I am not against public spending on infrastructure projects per se. I am against it being such an essential force in the national economy. These projects are usually financed with debt which can spiral out of control quickly.

>People have to stop thinking that public finance is the same as household finance.

Keynesians say that all time to justify weak currencies, high deficits and high levels of public debt. I know it's not the same but having a tightly controlled spending helps a lot. We have become so used to Keynesianism that we really think there's no other way."
319,"That's true, but it's a tense moment in that times with economic crisis tend to be the ones that cause war. For example the 1930s, and 1970s. I don't think we need to renew the whole fleet, but definitely a fighter or two is needed. 

But more of a priority is the financing of the solidarity wages, the introduction of income tax and the show of capacity to pay the foreign debt, so we don't have inflation destroying our economy. Every part of the Colombian economy needs imports to run, be it machinery, raw materials, services, etc. If our currency weakens further, and we have inflation, all of that will go up and we'll see price rises in every good. And it will have to come with austerity, which means reducing the new excellent highways being built, the new education budget, and everything else. 

We needed this reform. It was going to be a bitch to swallow, but it was going to feed us in the long term."

The practical result from you solution is worsening the recession. Regardless of what you think about it, it will happen, GDP will keep contracting and it will become worse.

Also, considering this is Latin America, sacrifices on whom? Because if I am going to apply my experience from Brazil, the burden will always be on poor people, never the rich. And the ones who always says ""shock therapy and sacrifices"" are the rich, who will mostly not suffer if the GDP drops by -6%.

You have to understand that, after 2008, many things Milton Friedman has said comes with a lot of criticisms. This thing about ""shock therapy"" is probably one of the most dangerous concepts I, as an economist, have ever seen in my life. Just go see post-soviet countries that went under this ""shock therapy"" and their standards of living from 1992-2008.

How are we going to deal with the structural effects a shock therapy may ensue? Are these effects strong enough to create a situation similar to Eastern Europe?

>I'm not offended when people call me monetarist. If wanting a solid and stable currency with minimal inflation makes me a monetarist, so be it. Inflation is a punishment for the working class. It's awful and being ""on the long-run"" doesn't make it any better.

First, IF THE conditions necessary for a ""solid and stable currency"", requires a strong industry, high education levels, a consumer base strong enough to stand currency shocks, how you can make that happen? Even more so in a ""underdeveloped country"" or a ""middle-income country""? It is not an easy answer, and it may require a help from government intervention.

Second, inflation is a game of hot potato, you always want to pass the increasing costs down, trying to marginalize the effects upon you, this idea of ""inflation is a tax on the poor"" may hold some value, but I find it misleading at best and dishonest at worst. Yes, high inflation is awful, but then again, pressing problems on the short-run will make everything useless in the long-run.

Third, there is some value on ""trade liberalization"", meaning countries with more closed economies are more susceptible to internal inflationary shocks since the demand market has not international option.

>I live in a country where people always scream that the government must build infrastructure projects to ""move the economy"". This is such a Keynesian and short-sighted concept. I am not against public spending on infrastructure projects per se. I am against it being such an essential force in the national economy. These projects are usually financed with debt which can spiral out of control quickly.

You have to understand that private companies will simply not invest in large infrastructure projects, and countries that are trying to achieve a high standard of living will need to undertake those projects if they want to get there.

There is no single example in human history of a country going through industrialization that did not do it. The post-war economic miracles of Germany, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and later China, are great examples of this.

How the hell do you want to make it easier for export industries in your country to increase production and connect to international markets without these projects, though magic?

>Keynesians say that all time to justify weak currencies, high deficits and high levels of public debt. I know it's not the same but having a tightly controlled spending helps a lot. We have become so used to Keynesianism that we really think there's no other way.

Dude, you have to understand that ""Keynesianism"" only agrees with high deficits and high levels of public debt during recessions. And having  tightly controlled spending is not always something you want to have, specially during a recession.

It's not that ""we are so used to Keynesianism"" is that it has proven to be a better alternative than trying to control the short-run fluctuations of GDP exclusively through monetary policy, even more so for developing countries."
340,They believe in eternally growing debt. That's the measure of their nonsense.
341,">but definitely a fighter or two is needed.

Totally agree. But they wanted to buy the whole fleet at once, that's the goddamn problem.

Jay, I agree with your second paragraph up to your solution. **This** reform (what was proposed or intended to propose) was not needed. What Duque needed to do is to follow the recommendations done by the Expert Commitee he tasked almost 2 years ago. Those recommendations are pretty different to what was proposed.

Do you honestly think that exemptions in certain sector cannot be dropped? That the country hasn't taken tax and trade decisions shooting itself in the foot? This is the extreme case when drastic measures could have been taken and for once in our history we could reacted to a crisis by helping the demand side not the supply side. But here we go again."

Incirlik air base is at 900 km from Deiz-er-Zor, so I say they're pretty well within fighter jet range even if you start at Puerto Rico, more with the US air-to-air standoff capabilities

>Why people like you insist to deprive Colombia from proper military gear?

Because a) There's no _inminent_ threat of war against a state and the citizen wellbeing is a more pressing matter right now b) Because the inminent threat is internal, and a whole fleet of F-16 are overkill for such task, as what is truly required are CAS capabilities (via drones or via other specialized fixed wing aircraft like the A-10), which can be cheaper. c) Because if the colombian air force want to get new toys as the F-16, they could buy them gradually in several years while upgrading the avionics and not buy inmediately all full price in the current situation.

Bacano que me pida a mi pruebas concretas, exactas con nombre y apellido pero usted sí puede generalizar. Se nota la doble moral

>También hay policías que han matado a ciudadanos, es verdad, en diferentes circunstancias.

La policía tiene la legitimidad, y los recursos. No es una situación donde las partes estén en igualdad de condiciones. El estado tiene responsabilidad y no cumple."
492,"¿qué frase no dice nada, la de la demostrar que el Gobierno dejó al Ejército que hagan lo que quieran? Eso haría toda la diferencia. Verían cumplido su deseo de que se sancione al Gobierno colombiano, y pondría a Duque en una situación muy difícil.  Ustedes los activistas de redes sociales siempre se quedan en eso, no le dan fundamento a sus denuncias. En muchos casos es porque en realidad no les interesa fundamentar sus denuncias sino agitar el avispero con otras intenciones.

la frase ""la gente sabe que las cosas están mal"" no dice nada, porque, para todo el mundo, hay cosas que están mal, pero no estamos de acuerdo cuáles son. Por ejemplo para un ""uribista"" puede que las cosas que están mal son las que para usted están bien y viceversa, ¿a quién le hacemos caso, al que haga más ruido y sea más violento?

&#x200B;

>Pues usted dice que las pruebas son oportunismo mezquino entonces ni modo con usted

¿? ... Dije que salir a decir que han muerto ciertos de personas a manos de la policía, sin verificar la información ni nada parecido, es oportunismo y también diría ""canibalismo"", es todo lo contrario a hablar con pruebas.

no, la situación del país no es la de Cali, en el resto del país no ha pasado ni pasa lo que está pasando allá. Ni remotamente.

&#x200B;

>La policía tiene la legitimidad, y los recursos. No es una situación donde las partes estén en igualdad de condiciones. El estado tiene responsabilidad y no cumple.

¿De qué está hablando? Salir a matar y a saquear, a incendiar bienes públicos ""porque sí"" nunca se justifica"
493,"Si todavía piensa que es porque sí, estoy perdiendo mi tiempo acá. Tanto texto pa decir nada. Simplemente diga que no me cree y ya. Nos ahorra a los dos esfuerzo mental."
494,I think I read somewhere that there is a Chavista sympathizer that is gaining popularity. That's kinda scary.
495,"I am against any tax hike.

I also noticed that people are demanding for more government intervention and even UBI (universal basic income) instead of asking for a smaller government in order to reduce the deficit.

*The bigger the government, the smaller the citizen*"
496,"Yes, I spend a lot of time in Colombia and try to keep up with the news when I’m not there. 

It sounds like bad economics to bring tax hikes and the poor and middle class when the economy has been at a standstill for the past 14 months or so. Consumer spending needs to go up for things to get going again, taking that money from them has the opposite effect. 

Plus international shipping companies put a brief halt on shipping to Colombia due to the unrest created by the government, and then police throw fuel on the fire with the violence that has happened. 

I truly hope things improve quickly"
497,Is it still going on? Media hasn't give it much coverage recently
498,It was very sparsely reported on in US media. It's a tax hike right? How bad was it
499,"IMO Inequality is the main issue in LatAm, and every country faces the same riots, we only need a spark. I don't know the whole situation in Colombia but I think is heavily related to Chile for example. And I'm expecting the same thing in Argentina, but we do it in December, it's a tradition (? 

So, while the background situation doesn't improve, we will have the same issues, and again, and again, and again..."
500,"There is a lot more going on, first this is just the beginning of the coup.

Ivan Duque, puppet of Uribe has bought lots of ammo for ESMAD and the riot tanks and VENOM system weeks before the riots and tax reform.

Alvaro Uribe and General Zapateiro have a dark history in killing/executing innocent people to gain popularity by claiming those where ""Guerilla members""

But even worse, both have/had deep links with the Medellin Cartel, Pablo escobar also had his own death squad called the ""Twelve Apostles""

[https://apnews.com/article/ad36c6626bec45c8876de3b9b4241587](https://apnews.com/article/ad36c6626bec45c8876de3b9b4241587)

&#x200B;

Uribe today is still running drug cartels with General Zapateiro there is clear evidence of that and have been sending hitmen to kill social leaders even now as we speak...

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OFW0MGV4yg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OFW0MGV4yg)

The whole tax reform was just to initiate the protests and excuse to cling onto power with a state of exception which is now very close of becoming reality.

Because elections are closing in and he has no votes in the world to win this election or even maintain a majority at all...

He also appointed his own judges and friends like a chessboard so there is nothing that can stop him from becoming a dictator.

&#x200B;

Uribe's government has stolen up to $25 billion pesos in fake projects, and all of them went free because of the same appointed people of this government.

We dont have any vaccines and yet Duque just approved a $14 million peso order for new munition for ESMAD

&#x200B;

Health care have worsened under his presidency and now he want to make it even worse while he keeps throwing more money to corrupt friends and family like Natalia Bedoya who has accumulated almost $200 million pesos for posting some tweets and sign a few documents.

&#x200B;

There seem to be no limit to their insane corrupt spendings, people are getting litterally executed and tossed in mass graves, most of the disappeared people just like Uribe did with the 6402 people he murdered in 2002-2008

People should not be worried about Petro, i should be more worried with this dictator because there wont be a next election."
501,"Ya I think it’s a bunch of lefty stupid shit mostly. 

If the Bill had been proposed by Petro they would like it. 

Doesn’t excuse the police killing people or the people killing police."
502,"Colombia has a lot of problems which from what I can see are the result of uninterrupted decades long right-wing neoliberal governments. That can't be healthy. At least Chile had Bachelet for a while, which I think helped soften the blow a bit."
503,"Being from Colombia, I've noticed a lot of sympathy for these happenings from many acquaintances of mine while I am opposed to anything related to that misleading cause.

Then, I think Colombia, as a country, is walking over thin ice with this. Wrecking an already fragile economy, cheering up social unrest, parading such failed economic proposals and ideas, and use all that as bargaining chips in a negotiation table only shows how deeply uninterested in Colombia's stability are those politicians and union leaders.

Picture them having complete rule over Colombia."
504,I know it's happening and not much else
505,"the good thing is he's leading the polls now, one year before elections. So, he will probably only go down in the polls from now on; now that he will be at the spotlight and everything he says will be magnified (and he does said a lot of stupid shit)."
506,[deleted]
507,"I couldn't agree more, my man!

Oddly enough, the Comité de Paro is demanding a bunch of expensive things that can only be financed with a tax reform. Then again, that's what you can expect with that bunch of greedy old men."
508,"With a smaller government, other actors just rise up to occupy the power vacuum. Especially actors with money or resources. I'm talking about big corporations, but also the military and other armed groups, criminals, etc. The average citizen remains as small as ever, except now without public services and infrastructure."
509,"Yes 24 days after, we still on the street. Some content in english that you can check: [https://www.instagram.com/p/CPHXsTphkn3/](https://www.instagram.com/p/CPHXsTphkn3/) [https://www.instagram.com/tv/COinFzjrhsV/](https://www.instagram.com/tv/COinFzjrhsV/)

510,"I think that inequality is a problem as long as it is a very powerful fuels for social unrest, but LATAM real problem is poverty. And poverty won't be fixed with interventionist, anti market measures. Sure, they are popular... But not effective."
511,"The protests are in a way cursed because there are many chefs in the kitchen. There are many demands that would be more akin to a government program, and therefore many red lines without giving reasonable ways to finance that expenditure that don't imply breaking the economy. But, TBT, the protestors were burned once by Duque in 2019, so that can explain their stubbornness.

I don't like Petro at all, and I see him closer to an AMLO than a Chavez. But to think the entire protest is a misguided cause or a Chavista plot as some from the far-right do, is disingenuous at best. People are mad because they lost trust on the government, who instead of offering reasonable solutions under the trying times of the pandemic, decided to placate their bases and their main donors at the expense of the middle class and PYMES. That, on top of the extreme violence displayed by the police and the overall disdain for the politicians due to the high levels of corruption and cronyism, mainly from the government coalition parties."
512,">and some taxes are better than others.

Increasing taxes in a country where corrupts steal over 17% of the national budget is like throwing money into a bottomless pit."
513,"That's the reason why I haven't said anything. Latin Americans love to complaint about the government and its corruption, but they also love to give more power to the government."
514,"Why a smaller government would generate a ""power vacuum""? 

[Mexico has a public sector larger than New Zealand but smaller than Venezuela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_public_sector_size?wprov=sfla1), drug cartels have significant power in certain regions of Mexico, no power at all in New Zealand and an institutional dominant power in Venezuela.

There is no correlation."
515,If you generate billions of dollars but it all pools at the top then you still haven't solved poverty. Reducing inequality is very effective at bringing people out of poverty.
516, New Zealand doesn't border the world's largest drug consumer who also sells weapons to the cartels. Reducing the government's size and power in countries like Mexico or Colombia would be insane for that same reason. Cartels would just step up and assume full political power.
517,"Latin America is not producing ""billions of dollars"", if we reduce ineaquality to the GINI point of 0 (every person receives the same income), everybody would still be as poor as the lower classes of Europe. Iraq is two times more equal than Chile."
518,"I'm saying if you were to create all that money, it is completely useless if it doesn't reach 99% of the population. Which it won't, because trickle-down economics are bullshit.

And there are plenty of Latin American billionaires."
519,">I'm saying if you were to create all that money, it is completely useless if it doesn't reach 99% of the population. Which it won't, because trickle-down economics are bullshit.

Trickle-down economics is not an actual economic model. It was invented as a boogeyman by the democrat left in the United States and later got exported to the rest of the world. Market liberalism would never propose a capitalism model based on ""charity"" or vertical growth. Modern microeconomic theory is based on individual choice, action and motivation. 

99% seems a pretty arbritary number."
520,Puede ir a donde quiera señor. No hay restricción de movilidad y no es ilegal.

Si ves una aglomeración de gente, evítala y ya."
523,"No existe ""ilegalidad"" en el movimiento, el problema es cuando aparece la policía, usted puede unirse a la marcha sin problema, puede caminar por el anden al lado sin mezclarse con los marchantes, pero el problema es cuando aparece la policia, los negocios en general no cierran a menos que existan disturbios, por otro lado si necesita moverse es mejor evitar las vias donde hay marchas para no perder tiempo cruzando esas vias."

618,"Customer service is not a focus of most businesses here. The excuse is typically cost related, but with limited competition, it's just not a motivating factor. The hassle to open an account at a different bank, plus the restrictions on new accounts, makes existing customers stay. And it's not like the next bank will be any better. Same goes for telecom. Three real providers here, so as long as one isn't significantly worse than the others, none will lose a large number of customers. 

The general Colombian market is heavily focused on price point. I have taught my girlfriend to look at price per gram or price per unit in the grocery store. She's shocked every time she finds a product she used to buy because the total price is lower, but the price per gram/unit is higher than a similar product of a larger pack size. In turn, she's also found that buying a higher quality product (beans for example) results in less waste from throwing out damaged product, plus time saved, so sometimes it's worth it to buy higher quality.

It frustrated me when I first came here, but I have a vehicle, so I've found the locations that have less of a line/wait. For ATM's, I've found the grocery stores with one connected tend to not have a line. I don't have a cédula yet, so entering a bank isn't a problem yet. For cell services, see if you're provider allows you to schedule an appointment online. At least that way you skip the line outside.

In my opinion, the issues in Colombia are nothing compared to the beauty, people and culture. I came from a very far paced, high stress life in the US, and I've decided to let it go and live on ""island time"". It's worked out well so far."
619,"La burocracia colombiana puede ser muy frustrate. Siempre que voy al banco tengo que armarme de paciencia. Toma muchísimo tiempo y la gente no siempre quiere ayudar. Un servicio terrible, como dices tú.

620,"If you just wanna take money out with a US debit card, look for Servibanca. There are almost never any lines there, and they let you take out up to a million at a time if you need it."
621,"Thanks for the detailed response.  I understand that you can't really switch companies to get better service because of lack of choice unfortunately.  But I'm legitimately curious how people hold down a job when these services demand so much time and are only open during the work day. Colombian employers don't seem extra generous with benefits/pay from what I've heard.  Making an appointment doesn't seem like a common option here. Just wondering how people could move apartments or buy a house or something that would require interacting with multiple services without taking a week off of work. 

&#x200B;

I agree that there are many benefits to living here that outweigh this one negative, just was curious about it.  I do appreciate not everyone here being overly concerned about time and efficiency, the US lifestyle is not very empathetic or forgiving and stresses me out too."
622,"They ask for time off and don't get paid for it. We give up to a half day off without reducing pay for personal issues, but that isn't common. Some employers, especially in agriculture, are absolute tyrants. Many people will have a family member handle it for them. If you think it's bad in the cities, imagine living in a rural community, and having a half day walk, or bus ride that costs about 15% of a days pay to even get to where the service you need is offered."

3.Entonces empeze a ver como le estaba afectando a resto de personas a mi alrededor esta crisis....y a muchos de los de la protesta les valia \*\*\*\* sus struggles y se mofaban.

4.Despues me empezaron a insultar por twitter y vi videos donde ellos tambien hacian cosas malas como los bloqueos de ambulancias-quemar personas con cosas molotov-atacaron una chica de mi ciudad-atacaron el ara al lado de mi casa.

Creo que el descontrol con alguno de los que protestaban les paso factura. Aunque duque tambien de cierta forma destruyo su partido.
645,"Me parece que la política de no negociar  por parte del gobierno ha cumplido su propósito, echar por tierra las buenas intenciones de la protesta, si a ello se le suma un comité de paro que no representa a nadie y un montón de revueltas que solo trasmiten desorden y  dejan vandalismo,  podemos decir que estamos igual que al principio o peor. Sí fuera necesario decir quién ganó y quien perdió, tal vez diría que ganó el gobierno, porque la popularidad de sus detractores está por el piso, sin seder mayor cosa, perdió la protesta porque no consigo mayor cosa, y sí dejo múltiples daños que afectan al pueblo, otro perdedor,  mismo que ahora aborrece la protesta esa misma de la que podría mayor beneficio."
646,"The results are interesting to follow over time. I think the margin of error for cities outside Bogotá is a bit high at around +-7% for a 95% interval of confidence (it reached almost 10% for the May 18-22 poll). Also, I've always thought they give too much weight to landline polling compared to cellphone polling (almost 2 to 1, a bit less in Bogotá which perhaps may explain the slightly lower margin of error). They explain that they do random simple selection of respondents within homes - the ones who pick up the calls. Now, what are the kind of people that are there to pick a landline call to answer a survey during the day? I believe there is a hidden skew here to consider. 

Putting that aside, I think that people in general right now are disgusted with politics and politians overall. How will that play out during next year's elections? It's too early too know. Nobody came out unscathed of the protests: Claudia López, Fajardo, Peñalosa, Uribe, Duque, the government-dominated Congress and the rest of government institutions. 

What's important in these surveys is to identify tendencies, most rebounds are well within the margins of error. For instance, you can see in the graphic clear waning of Uribe's favorable image over time. That in itself is significant but paired with the idea that people are not willing to sacrifice their freedoms for more security, a historic gap in recent disfavorability/unvorability of the police forces, and an increase in the unfavorability of the armed forces, it seems to me that the Seguridad Democrática doctrine might be slowly dying and that is good for Colombia in the long run, regardless what the election results might be in the short-run. 

Duque's approval/disapproval gap is still abismal. It caught my attention that La Silla Vacía's analysis on his numbers is misleading:

>Después de ese 18 por ciento, al que llegó antes del paro, con el debate de la tributaria, el presidente vuelve a tener el favor de casi un tercio de los encuestados. 

23% approval rate is not even a fourth of the interviewees, much less a third. There's no need to hype him like this. What La Silla Vacía didn't say is that 84% of Colombians believe that things are getting worse - 3% more than in May - which was the toughest month of the strike. Just 10% of the people think that the country is going well and this falls mainly upon the shoulders of the government. I have no doubts that the actions of the government-controlled Congress - whose favorability is in lows not seen since 1994 - affects its overall image, and Fiscalía, Procuraduría, Contraloría and Corte Suprema de Justicia all show worse favorability numbers.

The strike was never going to reach significant reforms of any kind - because of protests' devaluation as a mechanism to achieve true political change and this goverment's own willingness to rectify its course due to popular demand - but it certainly shook things up. It will be fun to see what happens in the months to come."
647,Donde hicieron esa encuesta en el chico? o en los rosales?
648,"Esos no es que estén muy bien de popularidad... Además, con gobierno demócrata en El Norte, no hay chance (afortunadamente)."
649,"Ojalá lo dieran. La única manera de salvar a Colombia es reconstruyendo desde las cenizas. Las instituciones democráticas están corruptas desde la raíz, cortar las ramas no cambiará nada."
650,"Si, hay algo que muchos no han entendido, si bien Duque es impopular no lo es por falta de medidas zurdas, sino por falta de medidas conservadoras (que fue el sector que lo eligió) en esa medida el será cada vez mas  impopular pero en pro de quien se presente mas conservador y con un discurso que apele mas a la seguridad y el orden.

Muchas personas quieren evitar el desorden de la izquierda y ven a Duque exageradamente blando, lo que afecta su imagen, pero no por las razones que la gente de izquierda creen.

La mayoría de la gente del común solo quiere un poco de mano dura para que sus vidas y sus trabajos vuelvan a la normalidad sin afectaciones.

En tanto se sigan dando estos exabruptos, si bien Duque seguiría mermando, no sería para dar ventaja a la izquierda sino para dejar abierto el nicho a quien se presente con el discurso mas centrado desde el punto de vista conservador.

Muchos celebraban que Colombia había ""despertado"" y no se dieron cuenta que lo que despertaron fue los conservadores que ya se estaban empezando a ir a dormir.

Ahora mismo cada bobada que cometa o Duque o el Alcalde de Calí o el alcalde zurdo de cualquier ciudad importante solo va mejorar la imagen de Cabal y ya quiero ver las estadísticas nuevas de los precandidatos van a estar muy divertidas ya que si bien Petro se presentaba fuerte antes del paro, el ""no sabe no responde"" y el ""voto en blanco"" siguen siendo mas fuertes en los últimos reportes, y creo que ese resultado se va empezar a distribuir hacia la nueva candidata conservadora.

Yo en lo personal que NUNCA he votado a ningún candidato del uribismo, NUNCA, tengo claro en este momento que si la segunda vuelta se da entre Petro y Cabal, me veré en la incomoda necesidad de votar por Cabal ya que me quedó claro que a Petro le interesan estos exabruptos y no le importa el desabastecimiento.

Muy dificil que yo vuelva a votar por Petro nunca mas en la vida."
651,"La popularidad del gobierno también está por el piso, en este mismo artículo lo expresan:

""Duque mejora poco por encima del margen de error de la encuesta, después de haber llegado a los peores índices de desfavorabilidad de un presidente desde que se empezó la medición, en el gobierno de Andrés Pastrana. """

Y como se explica entonces la creciente impopularidad de Uribe, quien siempre ha sido representante de la ""mano dura""?"

663,"Vamos a ver Uribe es una figura muy personalista. En algún momento dejará de ser un mesias, eso no significa que la gente vaya a dejar de ser conservadora. Hasta Churchill envejeció mal en su segundo mandato y fue bastante impopular.

La crisis de liderazgo se va resolver con liderazgo. A Uribe la izquierda lo suele sobredimensionar, cuando el solo representó la amalgama de todos los sectores politicos algunos dispares entre si en un momento de terrorismo sin precedentes, sin duda en la actualidad la situación está lejisimos de lo que era en el momento en que Uribe era una gran opción, pero no significa que ante el desorden producido por la izquierda el trabajador no vaya a desear orden..

Uribe no es una teoría económica o social, y su movimiento tampoco es un partido de algún purismo ideológico, tanto es así que hasta tienen ex guerrilleros en sus filas. Hay una nueva generación, gente que ni siquiera vivió el gobierno de Uribe que no por ello hoy tienen que ser personas de ""izquierda"", ""derecha"" o conservadores.

Uribe llegó a la presidencia después de 2 políticos bastante diferentes de el y Samper y Pastrana, Pastrana que era bastante parecido a Duque y Samper que era un zurdo de cabo a rabo, en ese momento la gente se cansó del desorden y el terrorismo y renuncó a las singularidades politicas en pro de un ""guerrero"" que trajera el triunfo.

Hoy en día no tenemos carros bomba o pescas milagrosas, Uribe ha envejecido, pero el desorden exige un poco de mano dura aunque esta mano dura no tenga la misma intensidad que en el 2000, pues hay que recordar que en el 2000 ir por la calle representaba un terrible peligro de morir en un atentado terrorista facilmente (a mi me tocarón como 3 o 4 ataques terroristas en diferentes momentos de mi vida)

Hoy no se da ese peligro, asi que es aceptable que ya no se necesite un discurso tan extremo como el de Uribe, pero el orden sigue siendo prioritario, ya no se necesita un guerrero, pero se necesita firmeza."

3. No sé si Petro sea Cocainomano, cada quién su nariz, pero decir que el aumento de expendio de drogas es culpa de los manifestantes es error, obviamente es algo que, al igual que el covid, venía a la alza desde antes del paro.


4. Y si por consumo de ""drogas"" se refiere a la Mariguana, pos, ahí sí se puede ser menos objetivo. Yo, en lo personal, no lo considero una droga como tal. Pero pues, cada quién su pensar respecto a eso.

Aquí tenemos un gobierno favoreciendo principalmente a la élite de su partido; ni siquiera gobierna a favor de todos los que votaron por el candidato de ese partido, ni para la oposición (lo que aqui se tiene como lógico) ni mucho menos lo hace para favorecer a los que no votaron. Se aprovechan y hace caso omiso a que Duque es el presidente de todos los colombianos y eso es lo que sacó a la gente a las calles.

686,"El glifosato o los productos que lo contienen son cancerígenos. 

Varios estudios científicos independientes (es decir, no financiados por Monsanto-Bayer u otras empresas agroalimentarias) han confirmado que el glifosato no sólo es peligroso para el medio ambiente, sino también para la salud humana.

Así que lo que me has mostrado es pura propaganda.

Además, me gustaría añadir que la deforestación no sólo está causada por el cultivo de coca; la deforestación también puede estar causada por el cultivo de soja y otros productos básicos."
687,"No, el paro no es apolítico. No puede serlo cuando aquello que motiva el paro es consecuencia directa de las políticas que han regido hasta ahora. El paro es una expresión de inconformismo político. Algunos de esos líderes son los jefes de cada sindicato. Quienes no nos vemos representantafos en ellos debemos construir mecanismos de representación o diálogo, también."
688,"Esa es una excelente pregunta, esos manes son sindicalistas hace años, y viven del paro, mientras unos pasan hambre y se matan con la policia ellos ganan plata 🤷‍♀️"
689,"está todo indexado como para hablar de propaganda, además la deforestación acá es por coca, minería ilegal y en menor medida ganaderos o sembradores de palma, acá no hay plantaciones de soya (al menos del nivel de argentina o brasil)."
690,"El tema es que el sindicato solo busca beneficio propio y las personas que buscan realmente el beneficio colectivo, han perdido el rumbo, es más se perdió el rumbo directamente de su origen, ""unión de ciudadanos para la defensa de los derechos civiles"".

Se volvio un tema de palanca, que un tema de unión ciudadana desde para ser veedores de los procesos públicos y vulneración de derechos.

Son visto como políticos, no como la representación de la clase obrera o popular del país, estoy seguro que muchas personas que están en el sindicato, son personas que realmente abogan por lo que la gente necesita, pero hay mucha gente, sobretodo los de arriba, que representan el egoísmo humano y de este país.

Ojala en Colombia se observaran las uniones laborales que se ven en Alemania o en Europa."
691,"La verdad es que la fuente que usted subio es muy poco seria, a diferencia de la respuesta que le dieron, muy bien sustentada con ciencia.

A fin de cuentas la coca son 200,000 hectareas maximo. Cuántas hectareas se deforestan por ganaderia en el país si estamos hablando de al menos 50 millones de cabezas de ganado?"
692,"La puse porque precisamente porque tiene una serie de links que redireccionan a las páginas donde están los estudios que están indexadas en lugares serios, si quiere mañana me pongo y le copio y le pego cada link (que era lo que quería evitar poniendo el link inicial).

Si son más o son menos no viene al comentario inicial en el que decía que el glifosato me parece menos perjudicial que esperar a que sigan deforestando; obvio es un problema la ganadería, el cultivo de palma entre otras cosas como lo mencione también pero ese no era el tema."
693,"Siempre he sostenido que en Colombia la gente no sabe de protestas, estamos acostumbrados a agachar la cabeza. La protesta se hace por un corto tiempo y luego quiere que la dejen trabajar, aunque este sufriendo fuentes necesidades. A eso juega el gobierno a que la misma gente, por agotamiento deslegitime la protesta, y pase de ser el verdugo al salvador que restableció el orden  Tal vez en momento determinado se reavive, pero si el colombiano de a pie no entiende que están son cosas de largo aliento y de fuerte inversión no conseguirá nada y seguimos en la situación que estamos. Mi única esperanza es que está situación le pase factura en las urnas a la clase política que nos tiene en las que estamos."
694,"La pregunta del millón es: Que legitimidad, quien representan los líderes del paro que están a la mesa de negociación.
Sin legitimidad popular no pueden llegar a nada. Duque hace ""damage control"" y no va a negociar nada con gente que no representan a nadie mas que ellos mismos. 
Los que manifestaron contra la reforma tributaria, el verdadero pueblo colombiano no afiliado, hace rato regresó a casa."
695,"Creo que se lograron muchas cosas que era imposible que sucedieran con este gobierno tan descarado:

1. Replantamiento de la reforma tributaria. Se sabe que el texto original genera descontento social así que les toca pensar bien el nuevo texto que todo el mundo va a estar encima vigilando.
2. Renunció el ministro de hacienda, el viceministro general de hacienda, el alto comisionado para la paz.
3. Matrícula gratuita en el semestre 2021-2 para estratos 1 a 3 (no es mucho pero es algo).
4. Reforma  a la estructura de la policía nacional, el ministerio de defensa, y la estupidez del cambio de color de uniformes y patrullas.
5. La concientización de mucha gente respecto a la necesidad de la educación y vigilancia de la fuerza pública en derechos humanos, que antes no era tema de conversación.
6. El desanmascaramiento del gobierno actual a nivel local e internacional como represor y violador de derechos humanos.
7. Más del 70% de los colombianos apoyó en cierta medida el paro (Mobimetrics), lo que evidencia el despertar social y político de las mayorías, y se naturaliza el exigir al gobierno cumplir un estándar mayor.
8. El fortalecimiento de los grupos políticos de oposición, dada su evidente influencia, que a su vez motivó a poderosos sectores empresariales a preguntarse si apoyar la campaña de los de siempre era necesario.
9. El retiro de algunas armas exesivas en el ESMAD.

Obviamente seguirá la mamadera de gallo, toca esperar hasta las próximas elecciones, quizá el descontento social se sienta en las urnas también, esperaría uno la reducción del ausentismo."
696,"La verdad no lo veo como fracaso porque no nos dejamos meter las reformas. Carrasquilla renunció y la comunidad internacional se enteró cómo son realmente los que nos gobiernan. Nuestra situación es muy compleja y no podemos pretender cambiar todo en un par de semanas, eso es imposible!  Tenemos que seguir día a día integrando los cambios que queremos ver en nuestra cotidianidad eliminando lo que tanto criticamos en nuestros políticos. Por ejemplo, si estamos cansados de la corrupción, entonces dejemos de sobornar a policías o agentes de tránsito para evitar multas. Si queremos fortalecer nuestra economía, entonces apoyemos a los campesinos y emprendimientos locales. Hay que dejar de vender el voto por un tamal o peor aún, seguir en abstinencia electoral. Hay que dejar de ver los canales que desinforman y manipulan. Hay que revisar cómo sembramos violencia desde nuestras propias acciones y tratar de cambiar eso. Lo que vemos afuera no es más que un  eco de lo que nosotros hacemos."
697,[removed]
698,"No consideró que fracasó, todavía hay manifestaciones en varias ciudades, hay encuentros ciudadanos y otras maneras de resistir. No fracasó, la gente se está organizando, se reconoce que la acción de salir a la calle no es suficiente, se están haciendo asambleas, se están creando organizaciones, hay más espacios de diálogo y de educación, hay más voluntad política de la gente, de conocer cómo puedo yo aportar,  qué mecanismos de participación existe, la política no es solo salir a votar y esperar  que los otros hagan, necesitamos que nos involucremos, en el territorio donde habitemos, que seguramente hay muchas problemáticas, bueno desde ahí, empezar, cómo hago una veeduría, cómo hacer una auditoría, qué contratos  se están haciendo, qué políticos no han pasado proyectos, esto es de largo aliento. Me siento muy orgullosa porque el paro sirvió para reconocer que somos muchos los que nos interesa hacia dónde va el país y nuestro futuro. Es el paro más largo qué he visto en mis años."
699,"El fracaso más grande del paro fue que a sus impulsores Petro y demás líderes lo hicieron con fines políticos, pero ahora que por causa del paro están muriendo cientos de personas, petro tiene miedo que afecte sus aspiraciones electorales."
700,"La falta de organizacion y exigencias poco realistas para lo que vive Colombia en el momento dan muestra del fracaso del Paro. Me parecio un atentado contra la juventud lo que ha hecho el tal ""comite del paro"" al apropiarse de las manifestaciones y sacar provecho politico con el dolor de los jovenes. Por otra parte, me duele en el corazon calificar a los de la primera linea como ""idiotas utiles,"" pues no fueron tomados en cuenta para las negociaciones, y ellos eran los que ponian la cara. Finalmente, esta forma de protestar, solo dio pie para que gobierno y otros grupos deslegitimizaran la protesta como mecanismo democratico, pues algo que debio ser un llamado a escuchar el pueblo, termino siendo recordado como bloqueos, exceso de fuerza y actos vandalicos.

Edit: como comentario final...Espero y aspiro que este descontento generalizado se vea reflejado en las elecciondes de congreso, senado y presidencia del 2022."
701,"El paro falló porque al gobierno no le importa los derechos humanos. 

Cuando las mercancías se encuentran estancadas por razones de logística a causa de los paros y bloqueos viales, ese problema es de los ciudadanos causado por los ciudadanos.

El fallo ahí está en el hecho que el paro no afecta al gobierno si no al ciudadano, especialmente al ciudadano de bajos recursos que no representa ninguna amenaza social a la élite del país, o sea los ricos. El gobierno no se responsabiliza de nada, ni en el pasado ni ahora.

La comunidad internacional no se mete, los estados unidos nos meten plata en el bolsillo y la desgracia democrática continúa gracias al lavado de cerebro tan hijueputa que nos han hecho."
702,"No la clase política no hace que se sienta frustrado eso uno lo hace solito,protestar protestar creo que debería uno protestar contra si mismo sus malas desiciones,su flojera,pero es más sencillo psicológicamente que otro tenga la culpa no yo,de lo que me pasa,Gente hay Covid cuídense y a sus familias, suben los casos por las aglutinamientos de gente de las protestas."
703,"Totalmente de acuerdo,las reformas ya se callejón,me tomé la libertad de leer lo que pide el comité del paro,y están grande pide alrededor de 132 cosas,que tomarían 5 reformas tributarias para hacerlas,ya que el problema de fondo es que no hay plata."
704,"No caigas en el mismo error que el gobierno.  Para el gobierno el paro no es legítimo ya y solo lo ve como producto de la intervención de Venezuela/Rusia 🙄 o el llamado electoral de Petro o gente pagada por los narcos, bacrim o guerrilla. Con esta justificación el gobierno hace oídos sordos y cierra la puerta al diálogo. Con esto el gobierno no ve qué los jóvenes que sigue en las calles lo hacen porque siguen teniendo peticiones legítimas. Los jóvenes quedan sin ser escuchados y esto genera más frustración.

El comité del paro no representa a todos los sectores. Eso es bien conocido e incluso lo han dicho ellos. Es responsabilidad del gobierno buscar canales de comunicación con los demás sectores, y si estos no tienen líderes claros, pues es también tarea del gobierno dar espacios y garantizar que estos liderazgos surjan. Por qué es responsabilidad del gobierno? Porque sencillamente para eso es la política."
705,"Pese a que no estoy de acuerdo con muchos puntos del paro, debo reconocer que estos en particular si los veo como logros...solo espero que en serio la solucion que salga de todo esta sea lo mejor para el pais"
706,"Tienes razon que se han logrado cosas compañero, pero el problema ahora sera ver que si se cumplan algunas de esas cosas que se han logrado o que el apoyo (o union nacional) se mantenga. Por poner un ejemplo de cosas que se dijeron para calmar los animos pero al final no se estan cumpliendo: la matricula cero para este 2021 al final se ha hundido en el congreso, asi que la promesa hecha por el gobierno con la cual tanto se ha dicho ""estamos escuchando al pueblo y ayudandolos en este tiempo de necesidad "" al final ha sido algo que han tumbado los mismos que son mas afines al gobierno en el congreso y con ello se ha demostrado que poca cosa se puede confiar en lo ganado (al menos frente a lo que ha "" cedido"" el gobierno central)."
707,"Gracias en por tus palabras.

En mis 3 décadas de existencia realmente no me habían sentido tan lleno de desesperanza, frustración y decepción. No veo un futuro en este pais. He sido privilegiado, soy profesional de una de las universidades de mayor prestigio del país y desde que me gradué hace 10 años he tenido trabajo. Si yo me siento así, no me imagino el nivel de frustración y desesperanza de los jóvenes menos privilegiados.

Me quedo con lo que dices, nuestra situación es compleja y tomará tiempo mucho tiempo en llegar soluciones de fondo. Nuestra lucha consistirá entonces en asegurar que estemos en la senda correcta hacia el cambio"
708,De acuerdo.
709,Sobretodo le devolvieron la popularidad a Uribe jajajaja. Si algo le hizo el paro al CD y a Uribe es mostrar lo desconectados que están con el pueblo y con lo que quieren. No digo que fortaleció a la izquierda. Pero no crea que la reforma tributaria que el CD casi le mete al país le encantó a todo el mundo.

711,"No estoy de acuerdo contigo. El pobre no es pobre porque quiere. Mucha gente se esfuerza, estudia y trabaja de forma honrada. Pero a pesar de su esfuerzo nunca sale de pobre. La movilidad social del país es inexistente, se requieren 11 generaciones para salir de pobre. 

https://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias-45022393

Hay frustración porque a pesar del esfuerzo no hay avances y la clase política y la élite que ha gobernado el país no hace nada."
712,"Imagínate la gente como yo... que a pesar de ser profesional graduada hace 10 años de Univalle no pude tener un empleo estable porque en mi profesión todo depende de la rosca. Como decidí que no iba a sembrar corrupción, he tenido que trabajar en lo que me saliera; desde logística en una pista de patinaje en un centro comercial hasta empleada doméstica de un extranjero (que es mi trabajo actual). Mi tiempo libre lo invierto en fortalecer mi emprendimiento y hago lo posible por hacerlo crecer. Aún así no voy a huir de mi país. Voy a seguir luchando para aportarle al cambio. Para que las generaciones venideras de científicos puedan tener empleos y verdaderas oportunidades laborales.  Voy a apostarle a sembrar un mejor país. No importa que no lo vea manifestado en lo que me queda de vida, vivo con la certeza de que nada es permanente."
713,"A nadie le gustó, ese es mi punto.
Si hubiesen dejado de joder Justo después de que presidencia desistiera con la reforma ya nadie lo querría."
714,"Una persona pobre,no estudia ya que el salirio de su familia es bajo y no alcanzaría a costearse los estudios universitarios,creo que a lo que te refieres de movilidad es a la clase media baja,la cual si estudia sea a base de préstamo, y sigue siendo clase baja, pero el mundo cambio y ahora no es necesario ir a la universidad para progresar puedes aprender a programar y certificarte gratis y trabajar muy bien,lo digo por experiencia,pero para eso hay que cambiar el paradigma mental,revelarse contra ese pensamiento de víctima,y tener fortaleza cognitiva,ahora más que nunca se necesitan personas que sepan de tecnología,éxitos y ojalá sepas que se puede todo es cuestión de misent y ahora con todo esto de la pandemia,cambiar de rubro."
715,"Si parce, pero que a mucha gente no le haya parecido las formas del paro no significa que eso le dio popularidad a Uribe. Los que veo que se pueden beneficiar bastante si son Enrique Peñalosa, Fico y Char. No apoyaron el paro nunca pero tampoco apoyaron la reforma. Una gran sección de la población se va a sentir identificada con eso."
716,"Te recomiendo este libro:

[https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Michael-J-Sandel-ebook/dp/B08BX9QJFX/ref=sr\_1\_3?\_\_mk\_es\_US=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=1YE800697NW8G&dchild=1&keywords=la+tirania+de+la+meritocracia&qid=1623804894&sprefix=la+tirania+de+la+meri%2Caps%2C224&sr=8-3](https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Michael-J-Sandel-ebook/dp/B08BX9QJFX/ref=sr_1_3?__mk_es_US=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=1YE800697NW8G&dchild=1&keywords=la+tirania+de+la+meritocracia&qid=1623804894&sprefix=la+tirania+de+la+meri%2Caps%2C224&sr=8-3)

Me parece super interesante porque critica el modelo de universidades y el credidencialismo que se ha creado alrededor del tema. Te aportaria perspectivas interesantes. La idea central del libro es que la meritocracia moderna crea ganadores arrogantes que creen que su posicion privilegiada es producto de su esfuerzo y perdedores humillados que creen que no sea han esforzado lo suficiente. Esta forma de pensar crea muchos problemas que son explicados en el libro. Por ejemplo hace que los ganadores sean menos solidarios o que el estado se meta en la vida de los perdedores para ver si se han esforzado lo suficiente y por lo tanto merecen un subsidio. En verdad es un muy buen libro. Te lo recomiendo, te dará nuevas perspectivas en que pensar.

Creo que estas juzgando las cosas mucho desde tu posicion y experiencia. Que bueno que hayas conseguido trabajo como programador. Efectivamente es una area que no requiere titulos, unicamente habilidades practicas. Pero no todos pueden ser programadores. Para ser programadores se requieren ciertas habilidades que no todo el mundo tiene por mas que estudien. Ademas, tampoco a todo el mundo le gusta. Que tu disfrutes pasar 6, 8 u 12 horas diarias frente a un PC no quiere decir que todo el mundo lo disfrute. Que pasará con las personas que no les gusta? Basado en tu experiencia, no puedes concluir simplemente que  solo es cuestion de esforzarse o cambiar el mindset. Es problema es mas complejo todavia, no lo simplifiques tanto!

Aqui un video que tambien podria aportarte otros puntos de vista

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ML6ABJqBU\_g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ML6ABJqBU_g)

El estudio que te envie sobre movilidad social en el pais con parametros objetivos de la economia nos permite concluir que realmente no existen las condiciones para que la gente salga de pobre o no retrocedan si lo llegan a hacer. Fijate que la conclusion de estos economistas no es que la gente no quiere salir de la pobreza."
717,"Agree... aunque se me hace que despues de la tumbada de la reforma la de la salud habria sido mejor. Habrian quedado como *salvadores* y el pais se habria ido contra Duque por haber creado tal problema  lol. Esto al irse tan largo y tener tanta desorganizacion lo que ha hecho es que muchos colombianos se esten moviendo a la derecha o los grupos Paramilitares esten creciendo de nuevo. No controlar a muchos de los que hacen vandalismo le ha pasado su factura a los del paro tambien. Yo tengo un vecino que era full-petro  y apoyaba resto las marchas pero una vez vio que no le estaba llegando el surtido a su almacen ahora anda pensando en votar por otra opcion.   


Solo mi opinion.   


Yo solo espero que esto realmente sirva para llevar a Colombia a un mejor lugar. Todo pasa por una razon. Creo que estas marchas han permitido darse cuenta sobre muchas cosas en el pais."
718,"Si el paro se hubiese desmovilizado en el momento en que se bajo la reforma, la reforma la volverian a subir meses despues, y ni el paro ni el cansancio sirvio de nada. Hay que ser un poco mas ambicioso."
719,"Siempre me ha parecido que el pueblo colombiano no sabe de protesta, es más bien una sociedad acostumbrada a agachar la cabeza. A estas alturas ya no se va a conseguir nada, el gobierno no va a negociar, porque el paro y los bloqueos en si mismos le convienen, juega con el cansancio de la gente para sacar ventaja política, hace las veces de salvador de una situación que no le interesa arreglar. Las marchas y las protestas son un procedimiento que supone un costo y una inversión muy alta para lograr algo, no solo en Colombia, sino en cualquier parte del mundo, en cualquier lugar del mundo se presentan desmanes y se salen de curso ( estoy seguro que a ninguno nos gustan esas cosas) pero en algunas ocasiones sin algo de eso la sociedad no logra moverse, no pretendo hacer una justificación del vandalismo, pero aquí, antes de conseguir algo la sociedad ya quiere volver a normalidad porque se canso, por eso es una sociedad acostumbrada a agachar la cabeza.

En cuanto a los infiltrados en las protestas, ni  siquiera se puede descartar que que exista de los dos bandos, desde los extremistas que dañar y destrozar es el único camino para reclamar, hasta los que usan los mismos destrozos  para desacreditar la protesta social misma, pues en ese caso particular siempre es más fácil culpar al que sale a protestar.

En fin, no hará falta desde el que no quiera la protesta aunque tenga necesidades y motivos pero prefiero callarse y aguantarse, hasta el que no la quiere, simplemente porque ni leva ni le viene y como están las cosas le parece más conveniente para sus intereses, algo así como si no me afecta, no es mi problema."
720,"Mi opinion: aunque la reforma como tal fue el detonante del estallido social no se puede tomar en cuenta como la única causa, los sectores vulnerables que son casi un 50% del país (hogares donde los hijos no pueden estudiar y deben elegir entre salir a vender dulces para apoyar a su familia o morir de hambre) actualmente no tienen nada que perder, ni vivienda digna, ni educación, ni salud, ni alimento, por eso eso se llegó a un punto donde no les importa morir, al final, con el abandono que han sufrido, con tantas noches yéndose a dormir acostado a los hijos con hambre, pues la muerte es el único gesto lindo que la vida tendría con ellos, por eso, no estoy a favor de que se levante la movilización hasta que estos grupos lo decidan, porque la movilización es de ellos, los que comemos 3 veces al día no deberíamos ni siquiera discutirlo


Hay otro problema y es que el gobierno no está interesado en hablar con esta población, por ese mismo motivo no se llega a ningún acuerdo con el comité de paro aunque este haya sido prácticamente armado por el gobierno, porque no les interesa, quieren que los pobres sigan bloqueando porque solo van a afectar a otros pobres, y final, los pobres de derecha en su burbuja de privilegios que no son tan privilegios pensarán que el verdadero enemigo son los pobres anti derecha que actualmente se mueren de hambre

En resumen, estamos ante otro triste episodio de la historia colombiana"
721,"Conozco a una persona relativamente cercana y que es algo conocedora del ambiente político en su interior, así como de los movimientos electorales, él expuso una teoría que se ajusta a lo que usted señala, dijo "" cuando la protesta se radicaliza, lo que ocurre es que la gente se derechiza"", creo que es a eso a lo que le apuesta el gobierno al no negociar, le apuesta a que la gente se canse, se agote de las protestas, al punto de que les afecte, para aparecer no como un gobierno injusto y retrógrado, sino como el salvador del caos y sobre todo del mal que deja la protesta.

Ojalá todo esto sirva sobre todo al momento de ir a las urnas para hacer una elección más madura y consciente, que le pase factura al sistema actual escogiendo mejores gobernantes, y no hablo ni siquiera de votar por Petro, sino de hacerlo de manera más coherente, independientemente de la opción que se escoja."
722,"Si, pero lastimosamente y con riesgo a que me downvoteeen a lo loco....la reforma de una u otra manera es necesaria. La pandemia dejo un hueco fiscal muy grande y se necesita de alguna estrategia para recuperar la economia del pais. No digo con eso que antes de la pandemia las cosas estuviesen bien o que haya que gravar los alimentos de la canasta basica como lo intento hacer Duque...pero si toca de alguna manera hacer algo al respecto. Todas las grandes crisis no solo.en Colombia sino en la historia del mundo han usado planes similares ""Plan Marshall"" ""el New Deal"" y otros q seguro no recuerdo. En este caso tumbar la reforma tributaria no me parece q haya sido el gran logro del paro como muchos lo quieren poner, sino que lo que hizo fue retrasar algo q es inevitable, espero que alguna nueva estrategia surja de todo este lioy que asi todo lo q se ha sufrido estos ultimos meses haya valido verdaderamente la pena."
723,Exacto bro. Eso es lo que el quiere. Ellos son maquiavelicos jajajajaa.  Sera esperar en que manos caemos. Yo votare por alguien que me parezca estable y no sea de los mismos. Sera esperar los candidatos que habran. Solo espero que Colombia esta decada vaya en mejor camino y tenga un tipo de renacimiento. Vale soñar.
724,"> dijo "" cuando la protesta se radicaliza, lo que ocurre es que la gente se derechiza"", creo que es a eso a lo que le apuesta el gobierno al no negociar, le apuesta a que la gente se canse, se agote de las protestas, al punto de que les afecte, para aparecer no como un gobierno injusto y retrógrado, sino como el salvador del caos y sobre todo del mal que deja la protesta.

Tal vez por eso el paro no está consiguiendo nada significativo."
725,podrian comenzar por reformar la reforma del 2019...
726,"La reforma habría funcionado, pero hay que recordar que vivimos en Colombia ¿Cuánta plata no se hubiesen robado? XD"
727,"Yo concuerdo con que la reforma es inevitable. Sin embargo, la reforma se concentra en pedir impuesto a las personas con pocos recuerdos o recursos de estrato medio. Hay muchos mas lugares de donde obtener dinero."
728,"Si es verdad, ciertamente la corrupcion empeora este escenario.....tal vez esta reforma con el gobierno de turno ya no fue."
729,"Una opinión impopular pero muy buena parcero!! 

La gente tiene que empezar a cambiar desde el interior, todos esperan que alguien les regale sobretodo en latinoamerica. Mis primos desde Colombia se la pasan diciéndome que les ayude a salir del país y me piden y me piden plata pero nunca quieren dar algo a cambio. Una vez le ayudamos a uno a venir a estudiar (Le pagamos todo) y al final no le gusto por que era muy difícil y se devolvió a hacer nada. Estoy a favor de la protesta y sé que el gobierno tiene la culpa de muchas cosas pero sé que la mayoría de la gente que conozco en Colombia no se quieren esforzar lo suficiente y no quieren cambiar para bien. Ahorita mi primo esta protestando por supuesta falta de oportunidades. 

La izquierda y la derecha es pura manipulación. En mi familia si digo algo bueno de petro ya me tildan de guerrillero y de vago, pero si voy a mi grupo de amigos y digo algo bueno del gobierno de Uribe me tratan mal y me tratan de estupido o de asesino. Todos se la pasan mirando posts o noticias de un solo lado sin mirar el otro y comparar y no aceptan un pensamiento diferente. Los del centro somos más pero nos tratan de obligar a escoger. Si matan a un manifestante, que mataron al vago. Si matan a un policía, que es que se lo merece. La polarización es lo que tiene al país jodido, la gente no se dan cuenta que somos de lo mismo, el gobierno lo sabe entonces usa la estrategia de separar al rival y manipular ambos bandos para que peleen. Por eso llevamos en lo mismo desde la independencia. Mi abuelita me decía que en la época de la violencia la gente no votaba por la persona que era la mejor para el cargo sino por la persona que dijera el partido liberal o conservados. El gobierno nos quiere separados y la gente no se quiere unir. Por eso yo también pienso que Colombia es un pueblo mediocre. El país va a seguir así hasta que se vuelva todo una guerra civil que puede durar otros 100 años y probablemente lo mejor divida el país entre izquierda y derecha. Lastimosamente como muchos me tuve que ir."
730,"Comparto mucho tu opinión, algo que también quiero destacar es la buena variedad de opiniones en este subreddit, poniéndolo en contraste con otras redes sociales, acá no se es tan víctima de la burbuja  de opinión en la que te envuelven las demás, acá he leído todo tipo de opiniones que aunque no las comparto todas, permiten forjar un pensamiento más sólido y dejar de lado la polarización"
731,"Toda la razon, tampoco entiendo porque joden tanto con que quieren que tal celebridad diga algo, acaso importa? Con la bandera al reves se demostro que se puede hacer llegar el mensaje a otros lados del planeta, ej lo de Luisito y otras celebridades gringas que dieron su apoyo"

733,"parce si! estoy 100% de acuerdo. eso se lo debemos a la mala educación del país. la gran mayoría jamas pasa de bachillerato, y por lo que he visto, muchos de ellos no tiene siquiera buen nivel de compression de lectura. Con tan bajo nivel, la mayoría solo cree lo que escucha y simplemente se deja llevar. Para los que quieren educación superior, tienen dos opciones: O son medianamente tesos, o tienen plata. yo trabaje en Admisiones de la UDEA, y cada carrera abre unos 100 a 200 cupos por semestre. Solo pasa como el 5% de los que se presentan. y de ese 5% mas del 30% no llegan a segundo semestre. En resumen: La falta de oportunidades, bajo nivel de educación, y una obsesión de obtener todo de forma fácil heredada de la era del narcotrafico. nos ha convertido en un país de importaculistas que solo se interesan por saber que dicen los famosos y ricos porque ellos quieren llegar a ser famosos y ricos pero sin esfuerzo, y como no tienen educación, no se identifican con los académicos y lo que dicen ellos son bobadas, así que mas fácil le creen a una cadena de Whatsapp con palabras como HUBIERON, HAIGAN y demás horrores ortográficos, porque es mas fácil creer en conspiraciones que en hechos. y es mas fácil echarle la culpa a la guerrilla que a los verdaderos culpables. NOSOTROS!"
734,"Hmm te daria un premio si tuviera. Yo la verdad estoy cansado con el odio que destilan ambos bandos. Todas las muertes son terribles y no es para alegrarse.

No todos son expertos en Politica para decir las cosas adecuadas en especial con lo confusa que esta la situacion. Ademas poner algo politico los pondria en riesgo al ser figuras publicas facilmente reconocibles.

Shakira recientemente puso algo apoyando a los del paro y que pararan las matanzas. Como la recibieron en los comments???? Le dijeron que era muy tarde que ya no servia de nada su comment. Que mejor se callara y que ella no era Colombiana cuando lleva decadas apoyando al pais mas que muchos. Tambien los Uribistas la atacaron horrible. Si no hablan mal. Si hablan mal. Que pereza. Recientemente atacaron a Juanes cuando el tampoco estaba de acuerdo con las matanzas.

738,"Personalmente detesto hablar de política con amigos y familiares, ni yo se que tengo definido como bueno o malo pero si algo tengo que decir es que si en internet las cámaras de eco ya son un problema bastante fuerte en los medios tradicionales es aun peor, uno que ya tiene un caminado acá maso menos tiene una idea general de como no caer en estas o al menos no ser tan pendejo manteniéndose a raya frente a estas. Aunque sinceramente celebrar la muerte de cualquiera es un estupidez tremenda, siento que una parte bastante grande del país aun tiene como única fuente de información los medios tradicionales que tristemente desde que empezó todo esto han ninguneado de una forma bastante fea las muertes de civiles que ni uno ni ellos saben con certeza que mierda paso y han glorificado a los heridos de la policía que dicho sea de paso son solo minions que andan comiéndose la mierda de las cagadas que hacen sus superiores por que si de internet aprendí algo es que por unos pocos pagan todos sin importar el bando en el que estés, siempre hacen mas ruido y se le pone mas atención a los que tienen malas intenciones.

Me parece que esta frase es lo único que se necesita para representar la idiosincrasia del país."
740,"Parcero, de acuerdo con usted en casi todo

Solo un pequeño punto en el que no estoy de acuerdo, y expongo mi argumento:

Colombia dejará de ser un pueblo mediocre cuándo reciba una mejor formación en la casa que haga que la gente se pueda valer por si misma y no depender de papá Estado, una dónde se prime el trabajo honesto y no la rosca o el fraude para enriquecerse o donde se elimine de la educación en casa la famosa (por desgracia) ""malicia indígena"". Ese es el fin de mi argumento con respecto a ese pequeño punto 

Para los que critican al fútbol, Yo las he pasado verdes cuando niño, y mi mamá sin apoyo del Estado me sacó adelante, aprendí el valor del trabajo y de valerme por mí mismo sin robarle a nadie lo que bien se ha ganado. El fútbol nos distraía de los problemas por 90 minutos cada día cuándo Colombia jugó el mundial del 98, es algo terapéutico  y que ayuda a despejar la mente y disfrutar unos momentos de distracción. El fútbol no es la causa de los males, es mucho más personal, de la casa"
741,Lo mas sensato que he visto en este subreddit
742,"Lo único raro de ayer es que entro publico después de que el gobierno perdiera aplazar la copa por culpa del covid y así pudiera asistir el público.

Ahora eso de pedirle a los famosos su opiniones en política est mandado a recoger, ellos nunca ganan al decir de que lado están y nuncan son la clave de solucionar el problema. 

Solo mira lo que le pasó a Falcao por algo que puso hace rato en su Twitter o con el caso de Amparo con Margarita."
743,"Mira que llego a estar de acuerdo con muchas de las cosas que dices, especialmente con lo de no alegrarse por la muerte de policías (o más bien de seres humanos), pero me parece que estás hablando de una forma como si tú no estuvieras criticándolos a ellos de la misma forma que asumes que te criticarían, te dicen tibio y tú a ellos extremistas. El centrismo también es una posición política que puede llevarse al extremo, y lamentablemente si una cosa es cierta es que el país necesita algún cambio grande, lo complicado es saber desde dónde. Nos guste o no, la farándula moviliza a las personas, y eso es algo que también ocurre en otros países más ""avanzados"". Muchos aquí a duras penas alcanzan a subsistir y menos tiempo tienen para detenerse a estudiar el país a fondo. Puede que eso sí les haga ""mediocres"" pero ése no me parece que sea un comentario que ayude a solucionar los problemas de fondo que llevan a eso, sólo polariza de la misma forma que tú estás criticando, es como decir que este país está lleno de mamertos que no quieren trabajar o de paracos. Lo que sí queda claro es que estamos en un momento en el que la gente está desesperada y no sabe que más hacer. Es necesario tomar acción, pero eso lleva al riesgo del extremismo; sin embargo, no tomarla lleva al riesgo de que no se resuelva nada y el paro al final sólo deje al país más desgastado."

746,"Eh sabes cuánto gana un futbolista como falcao? Es absurdo que no invierta su dinero, al menos una parte en ayudar a otros en Colombia. Eso es lo que molesta, todo estos futbolista millonarios que prefieren comprarse un Lamborghini envés de darle un techo a los más pobres. Creo que tú opinion es válida hasta cierto punto, pero no es cierto que el fútbol no sea una cortina de humo porque si lo es y además lo han usado para lavar dinero, entonces como qué es momento de reevaluar si necesitamos fútbol en este momento.

764,"u/kubick123 No quiero generalizar y solo estoy hablando desde mi experiencia. De las 150 personas que conozco bien en Colombia, 100 son jóvenes. Me crie en estrato 2 pero gracias al trabajo de mis papas pasamos a 3, así que la mayoría de la gente que conozco es estrato 3 pero conozco de estrato 2 y de 5. De esos jóvenes el 40% fue o esta en la universidad. Como un 60% de los que están en la universidad solo quieren salir rápido para parchar con los amigos. Muchos de los que estudian IT me dicen que les haga la tarea y no es por que sea difícil si no por que quieren hacer otras cosas o no entendieron el tema(y no se animan a preguntar o a buscar) y después o se echan la materia o al final del semestre le ruegan al profesor que les deje un trabajo para pasar raspando. 

El otro 40% es gente seria que estudia y trabaja. De los serios hay un 60% de probabilidad que encuentre trabajo depende de el esfuerzo que hizo. 

Los que no fueron a estudiar la gran mayoría se fue a buscar trabajo de albañil y a vivir del día a día, los otros viven con los papas sin hacer nada diciendo que no se mueven por falta de oportunidades.

Hay muchas oportunidades que no son fáciles de conocer por ejemplo en mi campo de IT muchas empresas de USA o aquí en Japón donde buscan gente de Latinoamérica o India(demasiada gente es contratada así) para que trabajen remotamente. Hay competencias de programación donde no es necesario ganar, pero con demostrar buena habilidad las grandes compañías de tech lo buscan para qué les trabaje. Saber ingles da mucha ventaja y es lo que más le recomiendo a la gente, por qué no saben la información que se pierden. Conozco una muchacha que se graduó de música pero sabiendo ingles le dieron trabajo en un call center en ingles y le pagan mucho más del mínimo. En mi caso me metí a un culto en donde ellos me pagaron la educación en Estados Unidos y nunca en mi vida pensé que eso era posible.

Ah, y no, tampoco es que yo quiera que todos se hagan matar por su partido y que anden siempre peleandose, obviamente seria mejor si la cultura colombiana, e incluso en otros paises, fuese menos violenta y conflictiva en estos temas y en otros miles mas"

El pueblo colombiano para mi, es analfabeta o ignorante, pero no mediocre, yo crecí en un ambiente de gente campesina, que gente para trabajar y para hacer cosas increible, esa gente no solo que nunca ponen un pero para hacer las cosas, si no que las hacen, si esa gente no tuviesen la necesidad inmediata de trabajar para suplir sus necesidades y la de sus seres cercanos, creame que todos serian estudiosos.
Pero lastimosamente, cada colombiano es una historia unica.

La vida es dura, tanto, que por más que usted trabaje y se esfuerce, puede que nunca logre algo por las circunstancias mismas de la vida.

Con respecto al punto de la India, hay mucha gente de allá que logra, un buen empleo tanto por trabajo más las circunstancias del empleo, su vida en ese momento.

Fuera de eso he hecho cursos y certificaciones gratuitas. Opciones hay en educación."
775,"Respecto a lo de elegir comer, el motivo por el que entré al SENA fue porque en mi familia ninguno tenía trabajo, así que las prácticas me venían de maravilla, eran 6 meses de trabajo asegurado y la posibilidad de que me contrataran después para algo, ya que sin experiencia en nada, no estaba obteniendo trabajo en nada.

Eso sí, no fue nada fácil, solía dormir solo 4 o 5 horas diarias para hacer los trabajos, y luego cuando estaba en prácticas hubo semanas en que llegaba a casa a las 2am para estar en el trabajo a las 8am. Pero ha valido la pena."

781,"Pido disculpas por adelantado, texto largo a continuación.

**Problemática:**

Quiero iniciar con lo siguiente del lado de la educación: Si considero que en algunas instituciones lo que se aprende no es mucho, y hay temas que considero nos son faltantes, ya que muchas situaciones se podrían resolver de forma distinta si todos contásemos con ciertos conocimientos desde la adolescencia.

Aún así, la posición que hay respecto a que es la educación pública la que siempre enseña muy poco la veo errónea, la educación privada necesita ofrecer algo para que las personas estén dispuestas a pagarla, y tal vez que pongamos estos conocimientos como lo mínimo para un trabajo es lo que está mal. Hay algo que me enseñaron hace muchos años, ya no recuerdo exactamente quien y era lo siguiente:

Cada categoría de la educación tiene un propósito, las carreras técnicas están para enseñar lo necesario para la ejecución de una tarea o profesión, siendo más o menso un 80/20 entre conocimientos prácticos y conocimientos teóricos. Las carreras tecnológicas están para enseñarte en partes iguales teoría y practica, de forma que sabes como se ejecuta una tarea y tienes las bases para tomar las decisiones requeridas en el momento cuando se presentan situaciones no contemplables en la planeación. Las carreras profesionales buscan enseñar la mayor cantidad de conocimientos teóricos para realizar el análisis y planeación previos necesarios para la ejecución de un proyecto a mayor escala. En resumen era algo así:

|Tipo de carrera|Conocimientos prácticos (%)|Conocimientos teóricos (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Técnico|80|20|
|Tecnólogo|50|50|
|Profesional|20|80|

**Mi contexto personal:**

Ahora, para seguir mi propia propuesta, mi contexto.  
Mi educación inicial fue privada, y en un colegio que me permitió adquirir unos conocimientos de varias materias como política y economía, ya que eran una materia de 10mo y 11vo grado. Eso si, no era un colegio de elite o algo así, el costo de la mensualidad era de unos 150.000 pesos hace 7 años.

Luego de esto fue la educación pública en el SENA, mi carrera es programación de software (por si a alguien le interesa, espero que no). Para continuar hacia carrera profesional en universidad privada (esto como sugerencia de uno de mis jefes, un hombre que respeto mucho).

**Mi propuesta:**

Hay que hacer cambios en la educación, eso es cierto, pero también hay que pensar en qué conocimientos nos hacen falta, ya que a veces pedimos cosas que de mejor o peor manera ya existen en nuestro país, solo que a veces las ignoramos. 

Pero también hay que reevaluar nuestro concepto del mínimo requerido, ya que si solicitamos conocimientos avanzados para tareas de ejecución, o para cargos que no requieren dichos conocimientos, estamos propiciando un circulo vicioso en el cual cada vez es más un despropósito el tener un sistema educativo escalonado (en teoría primero se es técnico, luego tecnólogo y por último profesional según como se de la vida profesional).

En conclusión, la educación si debe cambiar, pero también nuestra visual de que es lo necesario en la educación y para que tareas esto debería bastar, no tener los tipos de títulos como un adorno, cada uno tiene una implicación, respetémosla."
782,"Bueno, antes de hablar de revoluciones, habría que conocer todo el panorama, así como las herramientas que ya hayan para hacer cambios, o los cambios que solo necesitan ejecutarse y no implementarse.

Lo que usted comenta de los aviones, debo leerlo, ya que no conozco los detalles. Pero si usted tiene alguna idea de en qué sector habría hecho falta esa inversión, me gustaría leerla."
783,"La verdad veo la opción de evaluar o cambiar educación como algo viable, también se necesita mayor cobertura, todavía hay un 20% que no tiene acceso.

Lo que tú dices de conocimientos avanzados simplemente no es viable en un mundo globalizado, si hay mano de obra mas barata e igual o me costosa los industriales simplemente no van a venir, hay que ser competitivo. 

Lo que se puede es hacer un sistema por escalafones, muy estandarizado, algo similar a nuestro sistema de colegio, pero reduciría la calidad general de la educación al limitar mucho los temas que se pueder tocar y como se pode hacer. Y tendría otra ventaja, no más eternos en la u."
784,"Socio, usted la tiene clara no ha pensado en compartir este pensamiento o propuesta en algun otro lugar Aparte de Reddit? Colombianos en Reddit somos pocos, un grupo en algun otro lugar puede ayudar"
785,"Perdón nuevamente, texto largo a continuación.

Disculpa u/sapajul, no se si entiendo correctamente tu idea, lo que entiendo es esto:

**Sobre el sistema de educación:**

Entiendo que se buscaría hacer obligatoria esta escalada entre los títulos profesionales, de alguna manera, como podría ser por normativa, aunque creo que en este sentido es mejor no involucrar a las leyes, sino que sea algo más de nosotros como comunidad. (Si me disculpas, tengo muchos inconvenientes personales con la idea de que todo sea manejado por leyes o autoridades, siento que quita la capacidad de auto-control a la larga)

Respecto a lo de hacer un sistema de escalones, sobre el papel, esto es lo que son los títulos de técnico, tecnólogo y profesional, en teoría uno debería iniciar preferiblemente como técnico para obtener empleo con mayor facilidad. Luego, con tiempo y experiencia, buscar pasar al grado de tecnólogo, adquiriendo los conocimientos más teóricos. Así finalmente está el grado de profesional, el cual se buscaría cuando la persona desee aspirar a las posiciones más altas y de responsabilidad y planeación.

Con esto los cargos deberían tener una correspondencia más o menos así:

&#x200B;

|Título|Tipo de cargos que lo requieren|
|:-|:-|
|Técnico|Cargos de baja responsabilidad, basados en la ejecución de una tarea ya planificada. (Operarios, técnicos, asesoría, atención inicial al cliente, primera línea)|
|Tecnólogo|Cargos de baja o media responsabilidad que requieran el análisis de la situación para la toma de decisiones inmediatas en sitio. En mi opinión aquí podrían estar: Los primeros lideres de equipos, para equipos pequeños, aquellos encargados de problemas más complejos que un primera línea n pueda solucionar, tal vez todas las versiones ""senior"" de los cargos del nivel anterior.|
|Profesional|Cargos de responsabilidad, encargados de la planeación, administración y gestión de alto nivel. (Gerentes, administradores, lideres de área)|
|Especialización|Cargos de alta responsabilidad pero que a su vez requieran grandes conocimientos de un área específica|

**Acerca de requerimientos de contratación:**

En el caso de lo que expuse, lo de reevaluar que consideramos como requerimiento para un trabajo, lo dije por la siguiente situación:

Algunas ofertas laborales aquí en Colombia solicitan conocimientos o títulos de mucho mayor nivel de lo que la tarea a realizar requiere, y por lo tanto hacen que titulaciones que deberían corresponder a este nivel sean descartadas como no aptas EJ: Solicitar personas con título profesional para labores que se podrían hacer con conocimientos técnicos o tecnológicos.

Esto a su vez hace que todos busquemos dichas titulaciones desde el inicio de la vida laboral, y estas titulaciones obviamente son más costosas tanto en tiempo como en dinero. Así es como tenemos ofertas que buscan profesionales para ser operarios, o atención al cliente o realizar tareas que no requieren de los conocimientos que dicha titulación acarrea.

Esta situación la he visto mucho aquí, hablaré desde mi experiencia. En ocasiones me han llegado ofertas laborales de empresas nacionales, las cuales solicitan conocimientos muy avanzados (conocimientos que tiene uno de mis amigos y primer ""maestro"", el cual tiene más de 8 años de experiencia) para cargos de ""2 años de experiencia"" y con nombres tipo ""junior"" o simple ""programador"" (y el salario que esto implica). 

Por otra lado, he visto ofertas de empresas extranjeras o multinacionales, las cuales por estos mismos conocimientos buscan lideres de equipo o ""programadores senior"" de más de 5 años de experiencia, y por lo tanto el salario es el doble que el que ofrecemos aquí.

Entonces, ¿por qué aquí pedimos tantos conocimientos para un cargo básico y lo pagamos peor que en el extranjero?"
786,"La verdad, esta es de las primeras veces en mi vida que he decidido compartir mi pensar públicamente.

¿Ustedes tienen alguna sugerencia de formas de tal vez hacer esto?"
787,"Añado otra historia personal:

En mi primer trabajo, hace cerca de 4 años o así, el equipo de calidad éramos 4 personas, 3 ""tester"" (los que hacíamos como tal las pruebas de calidad) y nuestro líder de equipo. Los tester éramos todos graduados del SENA, e incluso yo era el mayor con 19, con el tiempo un compañero y yo empezamos a desear algo mejor laboralmente, yo quería pasar de calidad de software a desarrollo y este compañero un mejor salario.

Pasado un corto tiempo yo renuncié a la empresa para aceptar una oferta como desarrollador, una experiencia... digna de otro post tal vez. 

Por otro lado este compañero se cambio a una empresa extranjera, y le duplicaron el salario para realizar incluso menos trabajo, ya que en nuestro anterior cargo nosotros debíamos atender múltiples proyectos y trasnochar hasta por semanas seguidas, en su nuevo cargo solo debía ejecutar pruebas ya planificadas e incluso automatizadas (en otras palabras, solo revisar los resultados de una simulación).

Aquí pude terminar de confirmar algo que ya había visto antes, aquí buscamos personal con capacidad en teoría, muy superior a lo requerido y por el mismo salario. No apreciamos ni nuestras profesiones ni nuestros profesionales.

Y nos ha ido llevando poco a poco a tener profesionales mediocres, ya que adaptamos toda nuestra educación y aspiraciones como personas a este ambiente laboral donde el nombre del título ya no representa lo que debería."
788,"Hay 3 situaciones aquí

En primer lugar tu tienes acceso a una visión limitada de la oferta laboral de cualquier lugar, acá en Colombia he visto los dos casos, ofertas laborales con títulos como director de procurement pidiendo elementos acordes a la oferta como MBA 10 años de experiencia y 15'000,000 y lo opuesto, con nombre propio, PQP pidiendo un Senior Cost Management, con 2 años de experiencia y por 2,000,000 COP. Pero esto es un simple juego de nombres y título, para jugar con la oferta de personal. 

El segundo punto es que el costo de una persona no se limita a cuánto pagas. Por ejemplo si comparas con un salario en USA sin beneficios, tienes que multiplicar el salario Colombiano por 1.57, porque acá hay unos beneficios de ley que son una carga conciderable para el empleador.

Por último es el tema de competitividad nacional, miremos una bolso, tipo Totto, puede hacerse en Colombia, China y hagamos un hipotético USA. Se vende en centro y suramérica, A un precio medio de 40 USD, de esos $40 tiene que salir todos los costos, entonces, china, la mano de obra es barata, el transporte a puerto es casi que grátis, la materia prima es aceptable en precio, en Colombia la mano de obra es muy barata, pero el transporte a puerto es mortal, y los costos de materiales también son altos. En el hipotético USA el transporte y la materia prima son expectaculares, la mano de obra es terrible. Este balance es complejo y varía con cada producto, pero como es un mundo globalizado, hay muchos factores que hacen que la cosa sea mucho más que simplemente decir paguemos más."
789,"Bueno, respecto a salarios, no considero que una solución sea incrementar su valor, más bien lo considero una problemática tal y como tu la expones, ya que el alto costo de cada empleado para una empresa que causan parafiscales y otros beneficios que aquí poseemos hace casi imposible para una gran empresa la idea de ofrecer sueldos altos, o para pequeñas empresas la idea de crecer hasta ser medianas o grandes.

En mi anterior respuesta no trataba de indicar que el salario sea lo que está mal, sino el perfil profesional buscado, de momento no me involucro con salarios ya que es un tema muy complejo y extenso que depende de muchos factores relativos.

Es verdad lo que comentas de esta tendencia a adquirir únicamente el producto de menor valor, pero no es una regla siempre válida, eso también depende del mercado objetivo, ya que otros factores como calidad, ser producto ""artesanal"", producto ""de lujo"", afectan la demanda. Ahora, si tratamos de competir únicamente con estrategia de dar el menor precio, siempre estaremos en desventaja si queremos a la vez ofrecer beneficios a nuestros trabajadores. Es por esto que en mi opinión, desde el inicio esta descartado el competir en este aspecto, así que es necesario dar un valor agregado a aquello que ofrecemos al mundo."
790,"Creo que fue Porter el que dijo que las estrategias por precio no son sostenibles, pero el precio siempre debe ser parte de la estrategia. Colombia ha logrado lo que tú mencionas con el café, pero eso requiere siglos de trabajo y un elemento diferenciadores, en la época moderna es difícil y depende de los gremios y empresas para generar la diferencia.

Otros ejemplos en Colombia son el pescado, flores y cacao. Me atrevería a decir que azul ultra mar también.

El problema con esta idea es que como puedes ver es limitada. Y genera competencia interna, y vuelve nuevamente al precio. 

Necesitamos mejorar la competitividad y reducir los costos de flete, la situación es que ésto no se logra con protestas, quejas o violencia. Históricamente solo lo han logrado países con una política estable que favorece la inversión extragera, un ejemplo en Latinoamérica es Chile, aunque ellos lo lograron de forma cuestionable."
791,"Yo voy primero,

Un pirobo que yo ni conocía y su parche llegaron a mi casa porque un ricachón que me cae como el orto y es el que pone el chorro. Este pirobo era un completo pelmaso, se la pasaba pendiente de facebook, acaparaba la comida y la escondía para dársela a su combo y hasta rompió un pocillo y no avisó que la había cagado.

En fin, este cabrón, incluso después de que sus parceros más cercanos se fueran por las vergüenzas y el ridículo que hacían, nada que se iba. Ahí estaba, haciendo las mismas maricadas pero con gente que llamaba e invitaba a mi casa sin preguntarme.

Es así también con lo que mencionas, alguien dijo que se deberían suspender todos los partidos y que no deberían jugar porque el país está en protesta, pero ni siquiera cuestionan que ese argumento era probablemente aceptable para no celebrar una Copa América en un país herido, pero que nada aplica para un partido de un torneo diferente que así como mencionas ya venía planificado con anterioridad y que no se celebra en el país.

Lo que publico Mario Hernández aunque no sea cierto, no es alejado de la realidad, ya que cada trabajador afiliado al sindicato se le descuenta una parte de su salario, que anda a saber a donde va a parar."

Solamente están para hacer proselitismo para la izquierda."
851,">el sindicato de taxis y su negativa a la reglamentación de las apps

Para eso hay muy buenas razones. Las apps no resuelven ningún problema, y sí aumentan la precariedad de los dueños y conductores de taxi. Además, las apps no quiere reglamentar el sector; quieren desreglamentarlo para poder hacer lo que quieran.

&#x200B;

>Lo que publico Mario Hernández aunque no sea cierto, no es alejado de la realidad

Que una mentira concuerde con nuestra opinión no la acerca a la realidad... No está ni cerca de ser cierto. Además, si así lo fuera, lo único que muestra es el dolor que le da ver a alguien distinto a él y a los suyos ganando plata.

Eso no quiere decir que fecode no sea la cagada. Salir a marchar y a hacer conciertos, pero negarse a retomar funciones es un sinsentido total.

&#x200B;

>el sindicato camionero y si oposición al tren

Esos sí son la cagada. Pero no son sólo los camioneros, son los dueños de los camiones. Esos dos grupos no son lo mismo."

854,">Las apps no resuelven ningún problema

""La rueda no resuelve ningún problema"".

""La electricidad no resuelve ningún problema"".

""La física cuántica no resuelve ningún problema"".

Así de ridículo suena eso.

En cuanto a que las aplicaciones no quieran reglamentar, pues habrá algunas que sí, otras que no; a medida que pase el tiempo tendrán que ajustarse a las regulaciones laborales de todo el mundo."
855,"Es claro que las apps no resuelven el problema de transporte, pero si que se necesita una regularización como cualquier otro sector. Justo ahora las apps están haciendo lo que quieran porque no hay regularización, no entiendo como una regularización desreglamentaria el sector de transporte. 

Quieres un ejemplo de como ganan los sindicalista te muestro EMCALI, la mafia sindical que existe es tan grande, que ningún alcalde ha podido con ella, Mauricio Armitage fue uno de los que más batalló y fue el que publicó las cifras y la cantidad de beneficios de un trabajador sindicalizado, llegando a que un aseador este ganando hasta 4 millones y empleados administrativos de nivel 1 lleguen a ganar hasta 15 millones

Si quieres leer el articulo completo de los beneficios ridiculos de los sindicalizados en EMCALI te dejo el link.

[https://incp.org.co/los-insostenibles-salarios-de-emcali/](https://incp.org.co/los-insostenibles-salarios-de-emcali/)

Sindicatos como los de EMCALI hay muchos, y el problema no es que ganen toda esa plata, el problema es que no les importa si la empresa esta en crisis y pierda competitividad como es el caso de EMCALI, solo les importa recibir sus beneficios y listo.

>Esos sí son la cagada. Pero no son sólo los camioneros, son los dueños de los camiones. Esos dos grupos no son lo mismo.

Los dueños de los camiones por lo general son los lideres sindicales de los camioneros, es como en los taxis, son los dueños de los taxis los lideres sindicales."
856,">no entiendo como una regularización desreglamentaria el sector de transporte.

Por la regulación actual prohíbe explícitamente la modalidad de trasporte propuesta por las apps. Lo que quieren es que se eliminen esas reglas de funcionamiento (tarifa regulada, carros con placa especial, aportes a seguridad social, limites regionales para operación, etc) que no los deja funcionar como ellos quieren"
857,"No entiendo como eso es malo, al contrario, hasta beneficia a los taxistas quitar tanta regularizaciones y costos absurdos como lo es el ""cupo"""
858,"El problema es que ellos ya pagaron ese cupo por esa regulación... Haga la cuenta y verá el tamaño del problema. Hoy en día un cupo de taxi en Bogotá puede costar 80 millones. Eso no es un impuesto; es un precio de mercado resultado de las reglas de juego que dice (incomprensiblemente) que en Bogotá no puede haber más de 50k taxis. Ya hay gente que pagó eso por el derecho de tener un taxi legal en Bogotá. Cuando se permita operar sin ese requisito, ese cupo pasa a costar 0; el que ya pagó eso, perdió.

Hay 50k taxis en Bogotá. 50k\*80'000.000 = 4 BILLONES de pesos. 4 billones de pesos que simplemente se DESAPARECEN de un día para otro por quitar esa regulación para que Uber et. al. puedan seguir sacando plata de Colombia. Es un buen ejemplo de la importancia de la estabilidad jurídica."
859,"El cupo no se paga anual, así que los 4 billones no desaparece de un día para otro, ahora habrá que ver cuales son las cifras de taxis nuevos que entran a circular pero no creo que cada año entren 50k taxis, y con la presentación de algunos taxis, se nota que hay muchos taxis más viejos que matusalen

Otra cosa, el sistema de cupo, ni siquiera es regulado por el estado, ese sistema solo lo usaron los grandes dueños de taxis que son los que venden los ""cupos"" para aprovecharse de una ley absurda y hacer negocio. Que se quite el cupo, solo le quita ese negocio, por eso no les conviene que lo hagan.

Lastima por los que ya lo pagaron, pero el ""cupo"" se debe de quitar junto con muchas otras regulaciones, esto para hacer el sector competitivo."
860,"Claro, no es algo que se paga anual porque no es una tarifa, licencia, o impuesto del distrito o el estado. Y no se le paga al estado, es algo que ya pagaron todas las personas que tienen un taxi legal en Bogotá.

Pueden vender un carro vuelto mierda en 90 millones siempre y cuando tenga el cupo legal y luego ese cupo se puede pasar a un carro nuevo para seguir trabajando (el viejo se chatarriza o se vuelve carro particular con placa amarilla). Y esos 80 millones no los define el estado ni el distrito; es el precio normal de un taxi legal y la gente lo paga porque sabe que es una inversión rentable.

El día que quiten esa restricción esa gente pierde ese capital; el carro que antes costaba 90 millones ya no cuesta nada. Es capital colombiano, que está en manos de ciudadanos colombianos, se pierde de un día para otro porque ya nadie va a pagar esa plata pudiendo hacer lo mismo con un carro particular. Son 4 billones de pesos que se pierden de un plumazo...

Puede que la ley sea absurda, pero quitarla tiene consecuencias reales sobre personas reales que pierden su capital. No creo correcto que se haga tan abruptamente y menos para darle gusto a empresas con prácticas laborales y de impuestos muy cuestionables pa' que nos sigan ordeñando."
861,"Una lastima, pero no es culpa de nadie, las inversiones son así, o puedes recuperar tu capital o puedes perderlo, las personas hacen negocio sabiendo eso, no tiene sentido que no se reforme un sector económico solo porque hay personas que perderán dinero. 

Además, estas viendo solo desde el punto de vista del que pierde, tienes que mirar también del que gana, el que iba a comprar un cupo de 80 millones, puede ahora comprarse dos carros y ponerlos a trabajar."
862,"Según ellos  todos los demás son de Uribe, el único no corrupto es petro.  Petro es muy keynesiano, como es el gobierno actual. Creen que con petro Colombia cogerá el cielo con las manos."

865,"Creo que es un fenomeno mental-psicologico del populismo asi como pasa con Trump/Bolsonaro/Chavez. Petro les ha vendido ideas-mentiras y ellos empiezen a sentir que el su amigo y salvador. Petro podria atacarles su propia familia y ellos aun estarian al lado de el dandole honra. Lo mismo le pasa a los Uribistas que tratan a Uribe como un Dios.   


A mi lo que mas me parece gracioso es que Petro es de los politicos que mas dinero tiene en este pais y muchos creen que es del pueblo lmfao. Ese señor vive desconectado de la realidad del Colombiano promedio.  Lo que ese tipo quiere es enriquecerse mas....como la mayoria.  


Yo soy de izquierda economicamente-ideologicamente y vote por petro en las elecciones pasadas pero una vez lo segui en twitter y vi sus entrevistas me di cuenta del riesgo tan enorme que es ese señor. Su lenguaje corporal denota odio y egocentrismo. Es tan malo como los politicos del ramo de Uribe. Tambien la manera en que glorifica a Venezuela-Cuba-Chavez es de miedo. Cuando el agua suena es porque piedras lleva.....  


Yo la verdad siento que hay un monton de personas en la izquierda que tienen la inabilidad de ver las cosas que estan mal en su partido y denunciarlas. Para ellos todo lo que hace la izquierda es bueno porque es la izquierda y si dices algo malo usan la violencia o te llaman ""tibio"" zzzzz. Este tipo de ""niebla mental"" termina convirtiendolos en algo tan malo como la Derecha.  Es como cuando las personas de la izquierda condenan las cosas horribles que hace Estados Unidos pero se niegan a ver las atrocidades que hace China como nacion. La objetividad se ha perdido en los partidos politicos y es lo que nos tiene tan mal.   


Podran atacarme pero yo lo reitero. El siguiente presidente de Colombia no debe ser alguien del centro democratico o petro. Debe ser alguien diferente."
866,"Porque la gente sigue pensando que la solución está en el Estado o en un político profesional de turno. Por eso latinoamérica no prospera, literalmente siempre se busca un mesías y siempre sale estatista. Nada más ver la época dorada de Argentina con Alberdi y el liberalismo multidimensional, y compararlo con la actualidad. Debería darnos vergüenza seguir pensando así y creer que dándole poder al corrupto se acaba la corrupción y el malestar."
867,Espero que la gestión de Gustavo Petro arroje algún cambio positivo y no sea un chorro de babas como lo fue AMLO en Mex
868,"En el caso de los petristas, que son los que yo más he tratado, ellos no entienden que otras personas tienen otras visiones del mundo, que uno no comparte las premisas con las que ellos entienden la política o la sociedad. Por ejemplo ellos creen que supuestamente Duque se inventó los asesinatos de líderes, y que es Duque el que mata a los líderes, entonces creen muy ingenuamente que si Petro llega a ser presidente, esos asesinatos se van a acabar. Cuando la realidad muestra que los asesinos de los líderes son bandas criminales de diversas pelambres, entre ellas, las guerrillas, y que, en tanto esos grupos existan y operen, seguirán ocurriendo esos asesinatos. Es solo un ejemplo de muchos."

870,Este post es culpa de petro.
871,"No creas, a nosotros tampoco nos gusta Petro, a quién en su sano juicio le gustaría ese tipo, más de caudillo tiene Uribe.

Pero viendo lo que ha sucedido en elecciones, encuestas y lo quemado que está Fajardo luego de sus guiños hacia el Uribismo, yo votaría por Petro una y mil veces, sencillamente porque el primer paso del largo cambio que se necesita es castigar en las urnas a las ratas de toda la vida, cosa que nunca ha sucedido lo que explica su descaro.

Un voto para un tibio que quiere tener a los Uribistas contentos no es un castigo, es un premio a su omnipotencia.

Y un voto en blanco o para alguien que nunca va a ganar las elecciones, es darle otro mandato para Uribe, sea cual sea la justificación. Esa es la realidad."
872,"Porque no hay nueva sangre con posibilidades reales de llegar a un alto cargo, si no apoyas a Uribe entonces se piensa que deberías apoyar al segundo con más posibilidades de ganar, e igual si no apoyas a Petro.

Y lo de que si no estás con uno estás en su contra son cosa, lamentablemente, de los fanaticos que hay en los dos bandos no pueden sacar sus cabezas de sus culos y por eso piensan que Uribe o Petro son la única cosa que hay, lamentablemente son los únicos que que tienen una visibilidad alta."
873,"Hay tanto fanatismo en la protesta que a veces creo que si se tuvieran que operar de urgencia, lo unico que les preocuparía es que el cirujano fuera de izquierda.

Yo estudié economía y por formación sé que la derecha funciona mejor, mientras la izquierda  vende mentiras, pero no soy fanático y si hay un buen líder de izquierda lo apoyo, como en las elecciones pasadas que le voté a Ospina en Cali (aunque este segundo periodo resultó decepcionante), para eso reviso datos y la percepción de la gente.

A Uribe lo acusan de infinidad de mentiras pero uno revisa su gestión como presidente y fue más que aceptable. Mientras otros como Petro solo sacan disculpas cuando fue alcalde."
874,Estoy harto que me llamen paraco por dar mi opinión no petrista
875,"Bueno yo creo que el tema tiene un poco más fondo y creo que es donde se aprovechan los dos lados, realmente es que siempre existe parte de las sociedades que quedan completamente desatendidas.

Si te fijas desde la constitución del 91 no se ha logrado avanzar en algún cambio sustancial en cómo funciona nuestro país... 

La función del órgano dedicado a legislar no genera nada que realmente requiera la sociedad y suba quien suba a la presidencia no va a cambiar eso.

Creo que es necesario pensar más en un modelo de democracias directas donde la sociedad periódicamente se le consulte cuál es el rumbo y las necesidades, creo que es es la clave para romper este ciclo de siempre pensar que un grupo es el que nos resolverá todo y que todos tomemos nuestras responsabilidades dentro de la sociedad.

Y desde que sigamos bajo este mismo modelo siempre de un lado van a atacar el otro, creo que el mayor triunfo para ellos es generar esa división.

Uribe totalmente de acuerdo, pero Petro? Veamos por que lo llaman asesino, lo llaman asi porque estuvo en el movimiento M-19 un movimiento revolucionario que es reconocido historicamente por haberse tomado el palacio de justicia, participo petro de eso? no, Petro participo de otras batallas y mato gente? NO.  


En este video Everth Bustamante congrecista del partido CENTRO DEMOCRATICO y ex M-19 con honestidad reconoce que PEtro no participo en ninguna batalla, era un ideologo, que estaba alli por la ideologia revolucionaria, mas se abstuvo de cualquier hecho violento.  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2S\_RGRFGFU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2S_RGRFGFU)  


Entonces la gente lo llama, asesino, chavista, socialista y demas mentiras que dice la prensa, como no reaccionar mal cuando alguien que se come todas esas mentiras dice no gustarle Petro?  


A Petro le tienen miedo porque se comen la vil mentira del uribismo de que nos va a volver venezuela (que en un primer momento ya estabamos igual o peor y que el mismo uribismo con su titere con programa como el chavista alo presidente ya nos hiso dejar ver que ellos son los que no volvireron asi)

Entonces a Petro le tienen miedo por eso pero Petro sabe demasiado de economia, acaso el mismo Duque no hizo bombos y platillos de su programa de venta de Aguacates al exterior cuando el mismo Petro en su campaña presidencial del 2018 ya advertia del peligro de que Colombia siguiera dependiendo del Petroleo y no del agro? que paso luego? pasamos unos años donde el petroleo bajo a perdida, que tenerlo almacenado era perder plata y al contrario el aguacate se vende a mucho mas que el barril del petroleo hoy en dia.   


Que es lo malo de Petro? Curiosamente los que mas estan diciendo que los petristas no escuchamos y que no vemos como otros podrian tener ideas distintas son los que nunca han escuchado las propuestas de petro, abrir su mente y dicernir si lo que dice Petro tiene sentido o no, solo es puro prejuicio porque si Uribe es blanco entonces por lo tanto Petro es la otra esquina, Petro es Negro, ustedes los disque indecisos solo quieren olerse los peos y sentirse los moralmente correctos, pero no hacen una verga para dar una solucion al problema."
883,"Pues al parecer, y espero me equivoque, es mas un asunto de ""tradición"" el decantarse por un partido político y por tanto el ver que alguien quiera algo diferente es romper esa ""tradición"" lo cual genera malestar a esas personas acostumbradas a seguir con un patron de pensamiento preestablecido. 

Afortunadamente se que no eres el único que desea algo totalmente diferente y no comulga con ninguno de los dos ""bandos políticos"" (yo incluida), asi que no te desanimes que este cambio de pensamiento tomará un tiempo, tal y como lo mencionaste el país lleva decadas polarizado por tanto llevará un tiempo el que la gente se de cuenta que lo que necesitamos no es un ""partido político"" sino políticos honestos que realmente quieran hacer que el pais avance."

A mí me desagrada la comparación Petro/Uribe, se me hace bastante desacertada, Petro será todo lo mamerto radical que quieran y consejero de Chávez pero eso no es comparable a un warmonger como Uribe ligado a tanta historia del narcotráfico en el país y con tantos vínculos con narcos o wannabe narcos actuales. 

Lo que quiero decir es que Petro da mala espina con su radicalismo, zealot and caudillo behavior, y teorías económicas, pero no es comparable a seguirle dando el país a un ente criminal como Uribe. Si las cosas se reducen a Petro y al que diga Uribe otra vez la verdad me da menos miedo Petro que seguirle dando rienda suelta a Uribe."

También me da cosa de que Petro se ponga todo nacionalista de izquierda y quiera enviar a los venecos de vuelta a Venezuela, si una cosa buena ha hecho Duque es ayudar a los venecos si quiera dándole la oportunidad a los bebés y niños de convertirse en ciudadanos y a la gente que trabaja les ha prometió un camino hacia la ciudadanía, mientras que Petro ha dicho cosas como “hay que ayudar a Venezuela para que los venezolanos vuelva a su país” y eso más estupido no puede ser, no importa cuánta ayuda le dé el gobierno de haya seguirá violando los derechos de las personas además que ese lugar está en ruinas."

Lo de que Uribe es quien los mata ni siquiera merece comentario. Pero ya que menciona a Uribe, vale decir que durante su mandato fue cuando los asesinatos selectivos tuvieron un descenso más marcado.

Uribe tambien se saco fotos con Chavez y tuvieron sus amistades, pero nadie recuerda eso, Petro ha dicho que en venezuela lo critican porque no es amigo del gobierno de Maduro, Diosdadocabellos ha criticado a Petro, y aqui hay un video de PEtro donde critica el gobierno de Venezuela.

Apoyo a Petro porque se que es el unico candidato que invertira en educacion, y Colombia necesita salir adelante a punta de gente educada, no mas ignorancia para el pueblo.

En este vídeo  petro asiste al funeral de Chávez de no ser tan amigo no hubiera asistido, lo de Uribe con Chávez es más protocolo, es más se ha escuchado a petro decir que el error de Chávez solo fue depender del petróleo.


Lo de invertir más educación, y otros gastos que él quiere hacer suena muy bonito pero eso se paga con más impuestos, que tiene que pagar la gente del común que ahora está marchando por los impuestos.


Lo que no saben es que las empresas en Colombia son las que mayor carga de impuestos tienen en Latinoamérica. Por lo tanto si a las empresas les ponen muchos impuestos o se van o quiebran.

Y también más impuestos para la clase media 
Que no quiere pagar más impuestos


Otra cosa de petro es que cree mucho en imprimir dinero y eso crea inflación y pérdida del valor de la moneda."
932,"Las empresas públicas se costean con nuestros impuestos con la plata que recogen de la gente, de las empresas y si tiene perdidas se mantiene con la plata del estado, aparte que quieren menos corrupción pero quieren más estado y burocracia."
933,"Lo que es una completa estupidez, una completa imbecilidad y necedad es negar aquellos asesinatos bajaron considerablemente durante el Gobierno de Uribe cuando le estoy mostrando los datos. 

¿Usted sabe leer?"
934,"No es necesario, eso lo sabe todo mundo, y sus seguidores, puro uribista de closet."
935,"A ver lo que digo es que se puede replantear como gestionar una parte del presupuesto general de la nación que por cierto se aprobó el año pasado de más de 300 billones de pesos, para invertir en empresas públicas eso sí con veeduría y auditoría de las cuentas. Pero no se pueden robar los 50 billones ni tampoco dejar sin ejecutar parte de ese presupuesto, y viendo este gobierno pues esta claro que van a seguir mal gestionandolo todo."
936,"Yo pienso que el estado es muy grande y eso permite la corrupción y petro quiere aumentar el estado y aumentar el gasto. lo qué propones sería bien pero estamos en Colombia, hay mucha corrupción, no confío en los politicos siempre se van a robar plata y si se pierde la plata por robo o se pierde la plata por que el negocio no funcionó perdemos todos, además con todos los gastos que va que tener que tomar el estado para que termine el paro y más la pandemia no se qué tanto quede para invertir, pero ya veremos qué pasa."
937,"Bueno no se donde viste eso de Petro que quiere aumentar el estado, pues él y el sector alternativo piensan en eliminar muchos puestos públicos por ejemplo en los consulados del exterior y eliminar gastos como de camionetas para los congresistas y sus sueldos. Si hablas de reducir el congreso sería bueno siempre y cuando que procuren tener un total suficiente de representación ciudadana, eso debe ser debatido con calma. El gasto público puede ser alto pero eficiente, por ejemplo en países como Dinamarca que es como del 54% del PIB. El presidente puede ser Petro o cualquier alternativo pero lo importante es que el congreso que es el que debate las leyes sea la mayoría de los partidos independientes o de oposición actuales. Esperemos que el otro año cambie las cosas."
938,Es bueno ver que aún hay personas en este sub que hablan sin insultos y generan debate educadamente. Felicitaciones chicos!
939,"Estoy de acuerdo con la reducción de gastos inútiles, cargos inútiles y beneficios a políticos, deberían bajarse tantos puestos innecesarios y reducir el sueldo tan alto de senadores, representantes, montón de pensiones  que se pagan a expresidentes que ya son gente con dinero etc.


Ahora que el gasto público y el estado va ha aumentar eso es seguro, según su propuesta.

https://youtu.be/j-yUUIM7idU

En esta entrevista mencionaba su plan de gobierno para el 2018. Allí hay varios puntos en los que se va a aumentar el gasto al estado, crear más estado y subir más impuestos.

En Dinamarca hay políticos menos corruptos, además que pagan gran cantidad de impuestos."
940,"El gasto público tiene que aumentar de manera transparente si o si, la falta de voluntad política ha precarizado la economía, salud, educación, etc. Yo se que en Dinamarca pagan muchos impuestos, pero yo estaba hablando del gasto público, acá podemos potenciar el agro porque tenemos muchas más tierras que ellos para producir y exportar alimentos. Y con no solo subir impuestos pero para grandes patrimonios y riquezas, hay que evitar la evasión, y eso sería un alivio para el recaudo tributario, podríamos crecer como nación sin duda si tenemos en cuenta los puntos que te digo.

Con el video no me simplificas el por qué quería tener más estado, algo que me llama la atención, porque ya te comenté que la oposición hoy por hoy buscan reducir mayormente los cargos públicos. 
Yo no soy de Petro pero no me parecería una locura si él llegara a ser presidente porque pues es de los que más estaría abierto al dialogo y consensos en estos aspectos fundamentales que he dicho, eso si, no hay que votar por los partidos que hoy son la mayoría en el congreso, eso es lo realmente importante."
941,"El gasto público debería aumentar respectivamente con la capacidad del país, cómo sabe se cayó la reforma tributaria que iba a recaudar dinero para el gasto público,   si el gobierno se pone a imprimir dinero sería mal para la gente y aumentar la deuda pública peor.

Evasión siempre va haber, cuando hay personas que  tienen la capacidad de mirar y analizar los huecos legales, la subida de impuestos provoca la fuga de los capitales.

En el vídeo se comenta que se van a crear empleos directos con el Estado por sus propuestas de salud y educación.

Tampoco soy un fan de la reforma pensional que el propone.

Potenciar el agro está bien, pero yo pienso que este país debería tener más fácilidades para el emprendimiento y crear productos con valor agregado. No sólo quedarse en materias primas, se debería hacer más énfasis en el sector de servicios."
942,"Las cosas han estado tensas en Colombia y en el Subreddit :(

Espero no sea por mucho"
943,Life is hard....
944,"De eso se trata este subreddit, de eso se trata este país. Acá usted no puede tener una opinión conservadora porque lo acaban a punta de downvoting..o lo censuran los ""moderadores"". Esto está plagado de SJWs y political correctness. La doble moral por delante."
945,Dígalo sin llorar
946,"de hecho está llena de gente polarizada, gente que solo es A o B, oiga hay que ser uno muy plano y vacío para que eso suceda, y lo peor es qje este subreddit está lleno de eso, una lástima porque hay gente que está dispuesta a debatir pero los mods los censuran ."
947,Estoy en contra de la corrupción.
948,"Pues habia prometido no volver a postear nada politico por temor a un ban lol pero solo una ultima vez....

Estoy en contra. Ambos lados no quieren solucionar nada-poner de su parte y si esto va para largo pues adios a Colombia como lo conocemos porque caera en una crisis economica mas grave de lo que causo el Covid-Las Reformas. Yo creo que la mejor manera de arreglar las cosas es votar por alguien que no sea del centro democratico o extremista en las siguientes elecciones que ya son pronto. Los extremos han creado cosas como bolsonaro-trump-chavez-amlo.

Contra los bloqueos de las carreteras estoy totalmente en contra porque quiebra a las personas que menos tienen. Quien le va a responder a todas esos cientos de familias del agro que perdieron todo en Cali y ahora no tienen como vivir?  quien le va a responder a todos los que tienen tiendas de ropa y dependen del traslado de sus mercancias? quien le va a responder a la señora que vendia empanadas y ahora por los precios esta quebrando??? Aqui los derechos de unos no valen mas que los otros. La lucha va contra los politicos no contra los congeneres. Al mismo tiempo como es que Duque hace nada por los camioneros? que le cuesta? un cerdo.

Lo de que Colombia esta mal no viene de duque unicamente. Esto es de decadas y hasta ahora hizo ignicion. Yo no recuerdo que Colombia estuviera muy bien cuando estaban pastrana-samper. La Mezcla de los Politicos de Derecha y las Farc por decadas han llevado al pais a la ruina. Tambien no debemos ignorar que el mayor problema esta en varios de los Congresistas-Senadores-Las Cortes de este pais.....

Lo de las marchas es totalmente valido porque el pais esta muy abandonado y Uribe-Santos-Duque lo desangraron de una manera monstruosa favoreciendo solo a sus amigos ricos por años. Por otro lado hay ciertas personas en esas marchas con objetivos netamente de sembrar una Colombia comunista y algunos pagados por guerrillas-eln. Lo digo porque sigo bastantes del paro en redes sociales y tengo ~~familiares envueltos en eso.....~~

En twitter me han atacado ambos lados de la manera mas violenta asi que no quiero saber de ninguno de los 2. Horrible como el extremismo de Derecha-Izquierda se le mete a las personas. Tambien es un asco como Uribe-Petro han ayudado a incendiar el pais en vez de apagar las llamas. Que les suspendan los twitters. Tambien al ministro de defensa y bolivar.

Solo quiero que esto se detenga y se acabe el covid y Colombia de alguna forma mejore. Extraño la vida de antes que aunque era un desastre pues........ Colombia es un pais con cosas muy bellas yo no lo quiero abandonar."
949,"Me siento neutral. Tiene cosas buenas, tiene cosas malas. Me gusta la oposición al Uribismo, pero no me gusta la falta de orden o de ideas claras, realistas y articuladas por parte de los manifestantes. Tampoco siento que el paro tenga un propósito consecuente y claro en este momento, y muchas veces se siente que sigue más por momentum que por logros reales o concretos (obviamente en gran medida por culpa de un gobierno de mierda, pero también en parte por ser un movimiento descentralizado y a veces ambiguo). 

Es incómodo intentar trabajar y comer en un país en paro, pero más incómodo es hacerse el pendejo a las verdades de este país, por eso no critico a los que paran. Yo necesito trabajar y el paro sí me ha afectado negativamente, no voy a mentir. Pero no es como que hacerse el ciego y creer en el gobierno más mediocre e incompetente que he visto en mi vida sea una solución realista. 

No puedo marchar, tengo que seguir trabajando (hay que comer), y además me gusta mi trabajo. Me niego a darle la razón al gobierno que está matando gente en las calles, pero no veo avances de ninguna manera con el paro, y parece que mientras no haya figuras de liderazgo fuertes que organicen la cosa, no va a llegar a nada. El paro necesita líderes, estrategas y personas con el poder de unir y convocar. La masa no logrará mucho así."
950,Apenas ocho votos 😅. Yo creo que las manifestaciones se pueden juzgar separadas del paro y de sus versiones en diferentes ciudades. No es lo mismo quejarse de los efectos de algo en Cali que en Medellín no tiene los mismos efectos
951,"Una buena parte del problema es que dependamos tanto de las carreteras.

Al país le falta una infraestructura ferroviaria, que debido a las cordilleras no es nada sencilla de hacer, pero tampoco imposible.

Es increíble que tantas cosas se dupliquen o tripliquen en costo debido a que tienen que ser cargadas en tractomula por sinuosas y peligrosas carreteras, y esto seguirá siendo cierto cuando se acabe el paro.

En Colombia todo es caro, hasta lo que se produce aquí mismo, y la dificultad del transporte debería ser la principal preocupación de los próximos 5 gobiernos."
952,"Samper fue un cáncer para Colombia, cuando llegó el desempleo era del 7% y cuando salió fue del 16%, Pastrana lo dejó en 19% y Uribe lo bajó al 11%, Santos lo alcazó a tener en 9% un año pero con la pandemia se subío al 15%.

Hay muchas mas cifras para debatir y que si estudia quedará mas uribista que uribe."
953,"Gracias por esa opinion tan significativa. desconocia eso.   
Habia leido que los camioneros tienen como un **tipo de monopolio** y por eso en Colombia no tenemos casi trenes. Es eso cierto?  
Pero si ponemos vias ferroviarias no se irian todos a la calle? que se haria ahi? eso me parece bastante terrible.   


Yo estudiaba por el norte de Bogota y siempre veia pasar el tren ❤️ Love them.  


El otro dia estaba checando google maps en 3D y seriamente Colombia es un infierno topograficamente. Tiene unas montañas enormes y casi todo esta bloqueado por elevaciones."
954,">Hay muchas mas cifras para debatir y que si estudia quedará mas uribista que uribe.

Bajo Uribe el desempleo ""bajó"" sólo si se toma en cuenta la informalidad, que creció en gran medida bajo su gobierno y que en muchísimos casos no alcanzaba (ni alcanza) el salario mínimo.  La industria manufacturera y el comercio bajo Uribe *decrecieron* 6.3% y 2.9%, casi todo el crecimiento económico ocurrió en la extracción de petróleo y la minería por parte de extranjeros. La desigualdad durante esa gestión también incrementó, llegando a posicionar a Colombia como el quinto país más desigual del mundo."
955,"No necesariamente es por el monopolio de los camioneros.

El terreno es difícil, esa es la principal razón.

Y pues para comprar un camión se necesitan unos cientos de millones de pesos y se pone a trabajar.

Mientras que para invertir en vías férreas se necesita mil o diez mil veces más dinero, coordinación y poca corrupción.

Es más bien que hacemos lo que podemos, cada uno a su manera, cuidando sus propios intereses, pero a la hora de organizarnos nada."

957,"Clase media y pobre. Los ricos/upper class pueden sobrevivir hasta que se agoten sus ahorros,pueden irse del pais o tienen propiedades en arriendo de las cuales viviran.

Mi tio que trabajaba en el agro en Cali fue despedido asi como un monton de familias-conductores-galponeros. El esta pensando en irse para canada-bogota-la costa tiene buen curriculum y contactos........Los trabajadores de esas empresas? a mirar como buscan trabajo en medio de una crisis traida por pandemia  en una ciudad casi destruida (Cali) y seguro tienen varios hijos que alimentar.

Tambien de acuerdo con que el paro destruyo la reputacion del centro democratico. Esto fue como el maximo golpe para Uribe. Aunque por otro lado yo siento que si esto se alarga mal y empiezan a cerrar todas las empresas-negocios por la crisis las personas se iran es a la extrema derecha y los Paramilitares creceran enormemente y ahi si dara miedo. Se imaginan un Bolsonaro para Colombia?"
958,"El pueblo es el que se está terminando de curtir

959,La reputación del uribismo.
960,"Repite la encuesta, mismas opciones de respuesta, pero con alguna de estas preguntas:

* ¿Quiénes fueron los más afectados por la ley 100?
* ¿A quiénes afectarían más las fallidas reformas tributaria y a la salud?
* ¿Quienes son los principales afectados por los excesos del ESMAD?

Esas te darán respuesras similiares, ¿verdad? Y qué pasaría si las preguntas fueran:

* ¿Quienes recibieron la mayor cantidad de ayudas del gobierno durante la pandemia?
* ¿Qué sectores tienen las tasas de interés más bajos de préstamos del Banco de la Repúlica?
* ¿Quiénes se oponen más a que vengan entidades verificadoras de derechos humanos?"
961,"Los ricos, los pobres y la clase media ya venían de bajada"
962,"ay me equivoque y le di en empresarios, pero tambien son afectados"
963,"Pues nada más les cuento, mi papá es independiente y trabaja con varias empresas, una de ellas es una empresa de transporte que venía mal desde la cuarentena y cuando por fin se estaba recuperando llegó el paro, y hace poco quebró y tenía una nómina de 60 empleados, la mayoría de ellos conductores de buses que han trabajado toda la vida en eso y que dudo puedan conseguir empleo en lo que saben hacer en este momento tan difícil del país, imaginen que como esas 60 familias, hay muchísimas otras que hoy no tienen sustento"
964,"En un paro la clase media y los trabajadores, son los que hacen los mayores esfuerzos y quienes más invierten, sin embrago, son quienes mayores ganancias pueden obtener si persisten en la búsqueda de sus derechos. Sí no son ellos quiénes los defienden y los buscan  nadie lo hará por ellos."
965,La guerrilla ha sido la más afectada positivamente
966,Te faltó poner la economía
967,I love democracy
968,"Los narcos son los más afectados, por eso el gobierno está que levanta todos los bloqueos. Si no exportamos cocaína ahí si se quiebra este en país."
969,Como ha destruido la reputación del centro democrático? Es una pregunta sincera.
970,Eso no será nada si en las próximas elecciones la gente no aprende la lección y vota por los mismos.
971,La solución es ahorcar al pueblo?
972,"La reputación de Petro 

(si es que un ex empleado de Pablo Escobar puede tener alguna)"
973,"Le puedo empezar por responder desde lo que sé sobre la Ley 100 y sus efectos. Toda Colombia fue muy afectada, positivamente. Permitió aumentar el gasto público en salud; incentivó la inversión privada en el sistema; tuvo un impacto social significativo, cerrando la brecha en el uso del servicio de salud; promovió la protección financiera del sistema lo que ha permitido cubrir enfermedades de alto costo; la cobertura en salud creció muy significativamente; el gasto de bolsillo en   
 salud de los colombianos actualmente es de los más bajos en América Latina.En esa época la esperanza de vida en Colombia era como de 63 años, hoy en día es de 79 años. Muchos otros indicadores de salud del país demuestran un impacto muy positivo.

Con respecto a su segunda pregunta, es mucho más complicada la respuesta porque ambos proyectos de reforma tenían muchos puntos, sobre todos se podía discutir su conveniencia o no. Por ejemplo Claudia López alabó recientemente varios puntos de la reforma tributaria que se cayó.

Su tercera pregunta es una pregunta capciosa.

La cuarta pregunta, los más beneficiados fueron mipymes que pudieron cubrir diversos gastos de seguridad social, por ejemplo. Esas pequeñas y medianas empresas constituyen la gran mayoría de las empresas del país. Y también la gente que recibió subsidios directos.

La quinta pregunta me hace entrever que usted no tiene claro cuáles son las funciones del Banco de la República, y que está hablando por hablar en ese caso. Habla del BRC como si fuera un banco privado y, nada que ver.

Sobre la sexta pregunta, no sé, dígamelo usted. Lo cierto es que los organismos de DDHH como Human Rights Watch no han comprado el cuento de los grupos de manifestantes que han querido vender la idea de que Colombia es una ""narcodictadura"" y han dicho que apoyan y esperan que el Gobierno colombiano investigue y castigue los abusos policiales."
974,Gracias a la ley 100 yo tanto estudiando como desempleado tengo acceso a un medicamento de 6000 dólares al mes que me permite poder mover mis articulaciones por la artritis y solo pago 3400 pesos de cuota moderadora para cada aplicación.
975,creería que solo los pobres y clase media + mipymes estaban por reventarse.
976,"Quise decir. Ha destruido el Centro democratico aun mas. La reputacion ya esta destruida hace varios años jaajajaj  


Tengo varios familiares uribistas que les parecio tan abusivo lo de las reformas que pensaban hasta salir a la calle. Aunque muchos no lo crean hasta los Uribistas estaban contra esa cosa pero las personas no salieron por el problema del **covid-19**. Tambien a varios les enojo que duque no hiciera nada con lo de los paros por tanto tiempo (osea militarizar-conmocion interior)  y ya no creen que los candidatos de Uribe sean aptos para el pais porque todos les salen Judas (Esto lo vi en twitter)  Su partido esta quemandose.  


El otro dia discutia con mis familiares sobre eso. Ok les acepte que Uribe ayudo a que el pais no fuera controlado por las FARC hace decadas pero hizo algo mas??????  


Su partido lleva 20 años dominando:  
La educacion malisima...salud-EPS malisima....la brecha entre ricos y pobres enorme......los falsos positivos......lo del agroingreso......campo abandonado.....Santos llego y robo mas (No entiendo como ese señor tiene un nobel) y ahora Duque con amigos como este [señor](https://www.elespectador.com/resizer/kJVYMOC1peNQllQFyYJrXXU7pI8=/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-elespectador/public/GAVGEFFZDRG27GTEGTMEH3JEFI.jpg).   


Es muy claro que el Centro democratico ya no traera nada bueno a Colombia. Yo votare por alguien que no tenga que ver con Uribe-Duque-Santos en las siguientes elecciones. Eso si jamas petro. Ese señor no me gusta nada. Sigo su twitter y Las ideas con las que sale para Colombia son 0 viables economicamente y nos llevarian a la Ruina aun mas. Si por el fuera se pondria a imprimir dinero para mejorar la economia.

There are many other demonstrations like this one, every day in a city in Colombia, where hundreds or thousands of people go out to ask for a true change and better social, economic, educational, health conditions and that they do it in the most orderly and calm possible way.

1040,">Me llamó la atención porque un usuario - /u/Perro_amarillo \- me respondió entonces que ""en general no hay razón para que el Gobierno 'conceda' así como así ninguno de esos puntos"" que yo había sugerido porque ""no serviría de nada tratar de forzar un comercio entre Colombia y Venezuela"".

¿De qué está hablando? Con esa frase estaba haciendo referencia a las peticiones del Comité del paro, ninguna de las cuales tiene que ver con reabrir la frontera.

La segunda frase que cita hace parte de otro párrafo y de otra discusión, y además también la sacó de contexto y no hace referencia al cierre de la frontera, sino al hecho de que usted dijo que había que desarrollar el comercio con Venezuela y hacer regresar a los venezolanos a su país (con lo cual se contradice con respecto a lo de reabrir la frontera). Yo sí creo que la frontera debe estar abierta, Duque la cerró por la pandemia, Maduro la ha hecho cerrar varias veces. Pero dinamizar el comercio con Venezuela depende de que exista una economía en Venezuela, y esta cada vez se contrae más y más.

En ese mismo hilo hizo lo mismo, sacando de contexto y tergiversando varias cosas que dije. Le respondí de vuelta, lo refuté, y no respondió más. Aquí está la discusión: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Colombia/comments/n9lvzj/seguimos\_en\_pie\_de\_lucha/gxt501a/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Colombia/comments/n9lvzj/seguimos_en_pie_de_lucha/gxt501a/?context=3)

>Ahora resulta ser que el gobierno anunció que va a abrir las fronteras con Venezuela aplicando normas de bioseguridad. O sea, mágicamente después del paro desaparecieron todos los riesgos por COVID que mantuvieron dichas fronteras cerradas por más de un año

O de pronto ahora el Gobierno tiene una capacidad de hacer testeos mucho mayor que la que tenía hace un año, por ejemplo? Además de haber negociado y asegurado más de 70 millones de vacunas.  
  


>La realidad es que el gobierno empieza a mostrar su desespero porque sabe que tiene que reactivar la economía a como dé lugar y especialmente en Cúcuta,

O de pronto ese es el trabajo del gobierno? Intentar dinamizar y reactivar la economía, y buscar un equilibrio entre actividad económica y salud.

>la situación del gobierno es particularmente débil porque se quedó sin las cartas de acusar al gobierno venezolano de reprimir la protesta pacífica.

¿? Lo siento, Chávez, pero no. Los abusos de DDHH en Venezuela no dejan de existir en razón de lo que suceda en Colombia. Igual Colombia está en la OEA y en otros organismos, y eso la obliga a tomar parte en las denuncias y medidas contra esos abusos, de la misma forma que tiene que responder por los abusos aquí.

Lo que cita de Maduro no demuestra que tenga ninguna sartén por el mango, demuestra que Venezuela también cerró su frontera, contrario a lo que usted decía.

Mirando en su historial de posts también miré por encima y descubrí otras estupideces que dijo en otras discusiones, como que ""la reforma tributaria se aprueba al todo o nada"" (completamente falso)."
1041,"Esté abierta o cerrada la frontera con Venezuela, es lo mismo. Aunque cerrada es más peligroso en general, te lo dice alguien que ha vivido toda su vida ahí."
1042,"Se le olvida que ahorita en la frontera está una de nose cuantas disidencias de las FARC dándose palo con el ejército venezolano al tal punto que casi toda la gente de un pueblo venezolano se tuvo que venir aca, no lose Rick, eso no da ganas de abrir la frontera"
1043,"Hola. No entiendo por qué la molestia, si incluso tuve la gentileza de hacer una mención a u usuario para que estuvieras al tanto de lo que publiqué. 

En realidad no tengo ganas de discutir contigo. Creo que tenemos distintas interpretaciones de la discusión y, sin ánimo de ofender, no creo que estés discutiendo de buena fe. Yo literalmente inicié mi argumento con la siguiente frase:

>... debería Duque, por ejemplo, dejar de pendejear con lo de Maduro y los derechos humanos y abrir la frontera para que se dinamice el comercio con Venezuela... Nada más por ahí tienes cientos de millones de dólares para empezar a cerrar la brecha fiscal. 

Luego mencioné un conjunto de acciones que **yo** considero pudieran ayudar a recaudar fondos distintas a las que aparecían en la reforma tributaria original incluyendo - y esta es una idea enteramente propia, basada en evidencia y que mal pudiera yo endilgársela al Comité del Paro - de legalizar el cannabis e imponer fuertes tributos a su consumo y comercialización. 

Culminé la lista señalando que:

>El Estado tiene herramientas a su disposición para hacer frente a la crisis. 

**Unas herramientas que claramente partieron de mí - /u/Beginning_Beginning - no del Comité del Paro**. ¿Qué carajos iba a saber yo (o cualquiera de nosotros si a ver vamos) cuáles eran esas propuestas en ese momento? Y sin embargo tú empezaste a responder cada uno de **mis** puntos: ""impuesto a las bebidas azucaradas, puede ser, puede que no...""; ""medidas y proyectos en curso para reducir los gastos de funcionamiento del Estado ya hay varias...""; ""lo de impulsar el comercio con Venezuela no tiene sentido..."", y culminaste escribiendo que ""en general no hay razón para que el Gobierno 'conceda' así como así ninguno de esos puntos. Son cosas que requerirían muchísimo más debate y deliberación"".

Seamos serios por favor. ¿Ahora resulta ser tú estabas era respondiendo los puntos del Comité del Paro? ¿De dónde salió eso y cómo alguien podría saberlo?

Tú expusiste las razones por las cuáles lo de impulsar el comercio con Venezuela no tenía sentido, yo expliqué por qué tu razonamiento era errado y tú contra-argumentaste señalando razones adicionales. Es todo parte del mismo hilo de discusión. Estoy al tanto de la frase ""Obvio que yo creo que debe estar abierta"" pero ello no concuerda con la idea de que ""impulsar el comercio con Venezuela no tiene sentido"" cuando yo enlacé no una sino cuatro fuentes de empresarios colombianos solicitando apoyo al ejecutivo a lo largo de un año para que se abriera la frontera y así impulsar el comercio con Venezuela. Ya ahí no había más que responder, tú hiciste un comentario basado en suposiciones personales que no se sostienen a la luz de los hechos (y a la final tuve yo la razón, Duque abrió la frontera). 

Con respecto a lo demás no voy a comentar. Guarda esta conversación y revísala periódicamente cuando veas lo que va a pasar con Guaidó, con las elecciones de alcaldes y gobernadores en Venezuela, con la bajada de tono de las acusaciones de Colombia hacia Venezuela y el cambio de actitud del grupo de Chile, con la mejora del comercio binacional luego de que el gobierno colombiano se vea obligado a negociar de tú a tú con Maduro y se le olvide el gobierno interino y toda el cuento de los derechos humanos (que Colombia también se pasa por el forro).

A la final a los hechos no les importan los comentarios formulados en Reddit por un par de desconocidos."
1044,"Lo ideal dicta que un gobierno debería tomar las mejores decisiones para garantizar el bienestar de los pobladores. 

Una visión más pragmática (más cínica, aunque más ajustada a nuestras realidades) es que un gobierno debería tomar las mejores decisiones que le permitan mantenerse en el poder, lo cual uno esperaría que implique garantizar el bienestar de los pobladores para que estos los vuelvan a votar en las siguientes elecciones.  

La gente que ha leído este post y le ha hecho downvotes quizás no se ha dado cuenta de que, la ineptitud de Duque es porque no ha sabido tomar decisiones adecuadas, por ejemplo en materia de COVID (el bienestar de las personas), pero aún si no le importase el bienestar de las personas, más importante aún es que no ha tomado las decisiones adecuadas que debería haber tomado si quiere mantenerse en el poder. 

Puede que estando la frontera abierta o cerrada con Venezuela sea lo mismo, pero la percepción de la gente vale muchísimo y hay cosas que son indudables: uno, que Cúcuta está vuelta mierda y el cierre de frontera le dio durísmo; dos, que la gente de Cúcuta lleva un año rogándole a Duque porque abra la frontera; tres, que el Norte de Santander es crucial en el plan electoral del Centro Democrático para las elecciones del 2022; cuatro, que el gobierno así lo reconoce y - a pesar de haber dicho lo contrario hace apenas un mes cuando Duque ""definitivamente descartó esta posibilidad"" - le tocó volver a abrir la frontera; cinco, que lo hace desde una posición débil, con una imagen internacional seriamente opacada, pero negándose a negociar con Venezuela y apoyando a un gobierno paralelo venezolano que la Unión Europea dejó de reconocer en enero. 

De paso, está contra el tiempo en bajar las tensiones y reactivar la economía porque aún no ha acabado el paro y mientras tanto está tratando de mejorar la imagen del país y sacar una nueva reforma tributaria que tiene que pasar sí o sí y pronto, porque si no Fitch y Moody's también van a calificar la deuda colombiana como BBB- lo cual sería fatal. Para rematar, estamos en medio de un tercer pico de pandemia que está matando a 500 colombianos todos los días y que de repente obliga otra vez a cerrar los pasos por concepto de cuarentena (con todo y que ya ni nos acordemos). 

Esa es la realidad, yo no entiendo qué es tan difícil de aceptar. Como le dije al otro usuario: guarde este post y veremos cuál va a ser la actitud del gobierno de Duque frente al de Maduro en los meses por venir, vamos a ver cómo evoluciona el conflicto venezolano este año electoral, vamos a ver cómo Guaidó sale como corcho de limonada."
1045,"Lo que a ti y mí nos dé ganas es irrelevante.

Los downvotes a menudo ocurren porque a la mayoría de cuentas en este sub no les gusta leer posts de las fronteras, Cúcuta, Catatumbo o Norte de Santander cuando el autor es diferente a un extranjero. Suma que recordás las malas decisiones del gobierno y luego citas otro redditor con el que tuviste argumentos y obvio votarán con todas sus multis.

1078,"Una supuesta defensa de la democracia no puede servir como pretexto para argumentar que ""nadie los votó"", ese moralismo nadie se lo cree. Claramente nadie los votó porque son rebeldes, no participan en la vida civil. Así como un líder indígena o uno afrocolombiano difícilmente lograrían representación en el senado sin escaños especiales para ellos (como dice la Constitución que debe ser), a un exguerrillero también se le debe garantizar la participación si se reconoce que las causas de la sublevación eran legítimas (las cuales lo son, el hecho de que se haya implementado el Acuerdo de Paz demuestra que el Estado reconoce que las causas de las Farc eran legítimas). En ese sentido, la representación de las Farc en el Congreso es más comparable al de las minorías étnicas que a las de un parlamentario cualquiera en virtud de que reconocemos que fueron un grupo oprimido y por tal motivo deben tener representación especial, por aquello de garantizar la ""no repetición"".

Pasó lo mismo en Irlanda, en España con el ETA, en Uruguay con los Tupamaros (grupo al que perteneció Pepe Mujica) pero solo en este país tenemos la tara mental de pensar que los guerrilleros no pertenecen a la sociedad o que aparecieron porque sí, puestos a dedo por un dios malo porque sí, que los malos eran los campesinos de Marquetalia.

Los crímenes de guerra fueron hechos por el oficialismo (que aún sigue en el poder) y de eso hay amplias pruebas a nivel nacional e internacional pero por ellos sí no se escandalizan porque se ven decentes, estudiaron afuera y son, en términos generales, más lindos que los guerrilleros."
1079,"Es una falta de respeto comparar a líderes sociales y a minorías étnicas en su amplia mayoría pacíficas a traidores violentos, criminales culpables del asesinato de Miles de civiles, los crímenes perpetrados por las farc son más comparables a aquellos de los nazis en el frente occidental que a la consecuencia de alguna pelea idealista, además independientemente de que tuvieran ideales puros o de qué se les haya oprimido en un pasado distante lo que hicieron no se puede borrar, sólo un porque un grupo haya Sido oprimido en el pasado no significa que los crímenes y atrocidades que cometan están justificadas.

No parece justo parar una guerra sin consentimiento popular, no parece justo permitir que criminales de guerra tengan puestos de poder sin elecciones y tampoco parece justo que aquellos que les pagan el sueldo sean los mismos a los que atormentaron desde hace años.

Todos los insurgentes tienen buenas intenciones no significa que sus actos se justifiquen automáticamente ni que se les deba reconocer o premiar de ninguna forma.

Los crímenes de guerra del oficialismo si bien existieron fueron ampliamente casos aislados, no un modus operandi como lo fue con las farc, la principal fuente de reclutamiento de las farc era casi exclusivamente el secuestro de niños campesinos, eso ya es un crímen de guerra según el estatuto de Roma así como la toma de rehenes (práctica común entre las farc)  Así cómo atentados a la población civil o bienes civiles, el desplazamiento forzado y la instalación de minas antipersonales en áreas civiles, también son crímenes la ejecución de rehenes y prisioneros, la tortura de prisioneros y tratos degradantes hacia ellos. Esta es solo una fracción de los crímenes que han cometido estos traidores aunque por poco y violan todos los estatutos"

También es cierto que tenemos una clase política cuyo objetivo de enriquecer sus círculos prima sobre el bienestar general (tanto el gobierno y la oposición). Sin embargo, la economía sólo es una y un país próspero  tiene que ser rico. El esfuerzo fiscal por la pandemia se ha notado. Si bien Colombia tiene solidez en cuanto sus recursos primarios, no tenemos las condiciones para depender de ese sector. El paro ha puesto en relieve la necesidad de aliviar las cargas al ciudadano de a pie, sin embargo, ha gestado un descontento en otros sectores, las riquezas de los países dependen de la solidez de su sector privado. 

El cambio debe verse en las urnas, voten por expertos, gestores y buenos administradores, no se dejen llevar por el discurso populista, además recuerden que un países está compuesto por diferentes factores de poder, los cuales a través del consenso deben alinearse.

Llevamos 20 dias? y nada se soluciona..... lo que es grave. A duque le importan 0 las empresas prefiere hablar con fajardo,politicos de altas esferas o de la Copa America. Un presidente serio hace algo pero no deja que esto vaya tan lejos. Yo fuera el presidente andaria en reuniones todo el dia-todos los dias con ellos hasta llegar a algo.

Si duque hubiera sido menos soberbio y menos desconectado de la dura realidad del pais esto no habria pasado. El vive en una burbuja donde todo esta bien.

La marcha es pacifica entonces supongo no veremos ningun problema.....  Ellos tienen que no dejar que el matarife los use como carne para sus planes. Estoy de acuerdo en que se necesita una Reforma y no solo aqui en Colombia.

2) Claro que duelen los muertos por COVID, pero mas que las concentraciones de gente lo que mata es el desastrosos sistema de salud, donde los pobres no reciben atención y los centros de salud no tienen recursos para invertir en prevención. Ni el mejor ni el peor gobierno pudieron haber respondido a esta crisis porque fueron mas de 20 años de ley 100 acabando con la calidad del sistema de salud. Si no fuera por las politicas impulsadas por la ultra derecha colombiana, ciertamente hubieran habido mas UCI para atender a las personas. 

3) Sobre las cifras de policias heridos, se de primera mano que cuando los afectan gravemente sus propios gases lacrimogenos pasan las cifras de heridos.

1112,">y bajemos del poder a esa clase puerca que nos ha gobernado por 200 años

Eso no tiene sentido. Los problemas de Colombia son estructurales, cambiar a las personas al mando o que llegue un mesías que pretende arreglarlo todo, no va a cambiar de fondo las cosas.

Además de que es una frase sin ningún rigor histórico, suena bien (para ustedes) pero no explica la realidad y complejidad histórica y política del país de 200 años."

1120,De acuerdo. Los bloqueos están afectando especialmente a la clase media. Apoyo profundamente las demandas del paro pero creo que debe haber un límite en lo que consideramos como una protesta legítima.

Creo que yo me quedo con un medio internacional independiente como CNN.

Según el WEF Colombia tiene el segundo mejor sistema de salud de la región. Puesto 16 a nivel mundial. Lo siento pero si bien falta mejorar, el sistema de salud colombiano no es el problema. No le creas todo lo que dicen los políticos.

Los gases lacrimógenos rara vez se consideran una herida, en la mayoría de casos no pasa de ser una quemadura de primer grado. Las heridas de los policías son por falta de entrenamiento y agrecision con piedras y otros elementos, o se te olvidó que hace unos días quemaron con cóctel Molotov a un grupo del ESMAD, si las protestas son pacíficas para que llevan un cóctel Molotov?

El tema de los infiltrados me da mucha risa, sabes para que meten infiltrados la policía a las protestas? Para identificar a los vandalos aprovechados que solo quieren generar disturbios, porque recuerda hay gente que solo quiere ver el mundo arder, y hay gente a la que le conviene que se mueran 400000 gallinas, que el precio de la comida se duplique y que las industrias entren en crisis, cuentame quien se beneficia de una situación como está, y creo que ya sabes que pasa, porque a la fecha el gobierno ha hecho todo lo que los protestantes piden y cada día salen con algo nuevo."

Ahora es aún más fuerte, con más médicos, mayor cantidad de camas y espacios habilitados, o crees que los hospitales y edificaciones que invirtieron simplemente se desaparecieron o van a desaparecer al finalizar la pandemia?

La prevención era uno de los puntos principales de la reforma a la salud, que los protestantes tumbaron. Si había otros puntos terribles, pero este central es interesante que vuelva."

No solo porque ya lleva casi el triple de duración que tenia en la toma de ese dato, sino porque también solo representa las perdidas en ventas que estiman los comerciantes, es decir no tiene en cuenta los daños a bienes públicos que también hay que pagar. Por ejemplo, solo en Bogotá se tendrán que gastar mas de 20.000 millones en reparar el Transmilenio nada mas, y eso sin contar la posibilidad que en los siguientes días sigan vandalizando el sistema^(1). 

El grafico esta bien intencionado, pero los datos ya están muy incompletos.

Entonces más interesante que la cifra de 50 billones, sería saber dónde y cuanto se están robando en cada entidad y que ojalá la protesta se extienda a todos los que nos roban."

1179,"No soy experto en la materia, pero entiendo que el informe es por el 2018, creo que en presupuesto de la nación que indican ahí es de cerca de 840 billones y lo que mencioné en el comentario anterior era solo a modo de ejemplo, porque hay otros dos hallazgos de 66 billones y 15 billones, pero no los mencioné porque no entendí muy bien de qué eran"

Aquellos que apoyan los disturbios también etiquetarán a los alborotadores como manifestantes pacíficos para ganar simpatía por un grupo de vigalantes violentos.

No sé qué está sucediendo en este video exacto. Pero el alcalde ha estado en diálogo abierto con los manifestantes pacíficos. Sin embargo, 5 personas que fueron a la comisaría le prendieron fuego. La policía y los ciudadanos que se oponen al incendio de su ciudad se enzarzaron en una confrontación con estos vándalos. El alcalde alega que las mismas 5 personas fueron a su casa y lo amenazaron.

Es genial decir ""fuck the police"". Pero si crees que tener un grupo violento de vigalantes que quieren incendiar la ciudad y matar a todos los que discrepar con ellos (incluidos los funcionarios electos que simpatizan con los manifestantes) es de alguna manera mejor que la policía a cargo), estás loco.

Porque parece difícil? Porque la gente no está protestando por una problema, está protestando por todos los problemas que han tenido y que han sido desatendidos durante décadas. Hay quienes protestan por temas estructurales otros protestan por temas locales. 

Debe haber una reforma Fiscal y Política. 
Que se acaben esas pensiones multimillonarias del Ejecutivo y el Legislativo. No más pensiones a ministros, presidentes y congresistas. 

La corrupción en Colombia debe ser sancionada con medidas más severas. La precariedad estructural (vías, salud, educación) se debe a la plata que se ha llevado la corrupción. 

El voto en Colombia debe ser obligatorio. La abstención es funcional para la politiquería de siempre. En Colombia la política no funciona haciendo las mejores propuestas para convencer a la mayoría, en Colombia la política funciona ""manteniendo aceitada a una pequeña maquinaria votante"". 

De nada sirve que la gente proteste si cuando tiene la oportunidad de expresarse el día de las elecciones no lo hace."
1191,"El primer paso es que le ordenen inmediatamente a la Fuerza Pública parar la hijueputez. Noche tras noche son videos de zonas residenciales gaseadas y disparos contra civiles desarmados.

1192,"Bueno... Tengo esto atravesado en el pecho desde hace rato así que supongo que mejor lo saco todo acá...

Para aclarar todo creo que ideológicamente soy anarquista y de manera pragmática soy liberal... Así que la idea seria reducir el tamaño del gobierno gradualmente hasta que desaparezca por completo.

Con respecto a lo que pienso sobre lo que esta pasando actualmente (e incluso desde hace más de 10 años) en Colombia... Creo que la ""política"" acá se asemeja más a barras bravas e hinchas que a política de verdad, la gente ve en su caudillo la solución a todos los problemas y en el caudillo contrario la fuente de todos los problemas, pero como ud dice : 

>nos resulta imposible pensar que toda propuesta o pronunciamiento no lleva un interés en sus carreras, un cálculo sobre lo que les conviene o no.

Y yo opino exactamente esto, el estado es inherentemente corrupto, este en el bando que este, el que se suba al poder dificilmente va a  buscar la reducción del poder del estado, e inevitablemente lo va a usar para promover su agenda, haciendo más grande al estado, ya sea Uribe promoviendo la guerra contra las drogas y el conservadurismo social o Petro con progresismo y su idea de redistribuir la riqueza; pero lo peor de todo es que esto no es un problema que surja de los políticos, ellos solo son empresarios que buscan complacer a su clientela. Es decir, los políticos son el reflejo de lo que la gente quiere. 


Creo que tanto la ""derecha"" como la ""izquierda"" tienen el mismo problema, lo único que quieren hacer es inflar más al estado, quieren más programas para X o para Y, que inevitablemente lleva  a mayor carga tributaria para todos y por consiguiente jode a todos menos a los políticos. 

En cuanto a la fuente del mal que actualmente nos aqueja, La reforma tributaria, está tenía contemplado lo que Petro, Gustavo Bolívar y todos los de ""izquierda"" andaban pidiendo: Una renta básica... pero claro, debido a que eso es gasto estatal solo hay dos opciones para financiarlo, o con más impuestos, o con emicion monetaria.... Pero cada bando ve lo que quiere los de ""derecha"" dirán que duque quiere ayudar a los pobre y los de ""izquierda"" ven que les quieren subir más impuestos.  La protesta y el descontento social por todo esto está totalmente justificado, y me alegra que Duque pierda apoyo, el problema es que la gente no está pensando en acabar con la raíz del problema (el estado), si no que quieren llevar el poder al ídolo que ellos adoran (esto aplica para ambos bandos). 

Los lideres del paro tienen un montón de peticiones que obviamente Implican aumentar el tamaño del estado y por con siguiente el gasto pueblico, pero claro, ellos no van a necesitar ningún impuesto ni van a tener que emitir dinero para financiarse, para ellos la plata crece en los árboles... Y quieren redistribuir la riqueza en un país que no tiene ninguna.

La solución a todo esto? No la veo cerca, seguramente moriré antes de que suceda, pero creo que habra que llevar acabo una revolución cultural donde la gente deje de creer que el estado es el la gallina de los huevos de oro que solucionará nuestros problemas, cuando la gente se de cuenta que la raíz de todos los problemas es el estado y que solo destruyendolo seremos libres y más felices podremos comenzar a ver un cambio... 


Perdon por la verborrea, tengo en mente varias acciones concretas que políticamente apoyo, pero no veo que nadie esté pensando en eso"
1193,"En esencia estoy completamente de acuerdo con usted en cuanto a que la ciudadanía tiene que participar mucho más activamente, y empezar a organizarse mucho más desde lo micro. Además, pasar de la mera protesta o de disentir, a organizarse para proponer, deliberar, crear ideas aterrizadas y basadas en información rigurosa sobre las necesidades del país. Y en que no se puede esperar que un mesías llegue para arreglar todo, cosa que obviamente no va a pasar.

Pero las reformas y leyes no son solo un papel. Esas reformas y programas definen muchas cosas; la gente tiene que ser partícipe de esos debates; con organizar actividades micro de tipo comunitario no basta, para nada. El sistema tributario, pensional o laboral y las reformas que se van a hacer sobre esos temas, nos conciernen a todos y tenemos que informarnos muy bien sobre todo eso."
1194,"Me parece curioso que casi todos los comentarios vuelven una y otra vez a alternativas políticas, ¿por qué?

¿Mi propuesta de pensar qué podemos hacer desde nuestra esfera de influencia no es clara?

¿Definitivamente no es posible pensar acciones por fuera de lo político?

¿Nos cuesta mucho pensar acciones que directamente nos involucren/comprometan?"

la reforma tributaria no la vemos a comer si o si,no queda un culo de plata y como nacion nos toca apretar cinturon y sufrir hambre para pasar estar crisis

Ahora educar a los niños oara que sepan decidir a un buen candidato y no por un partido político, también me gustaría que si el candidato no cumple con sus propuestas que lo bajen de su cargo, estaría bien y en varios países hacen eso.

Más soluciones sería mejor educación, hacerle revuelta a la cámara de justicia, aprobar pena de muerte para curruptos, violadores, etc. Así que las personas tengan más miedo y más valor a la vida.

- Parar el 4 por mil( esto no es un estado feudal por que sigue existiendo) 
-Contratos con el estado no pueden completar si gerentes, dueños o empleados son gente/personas encontradas culpables de sobornos o corrupcion. 
-Usar parte de ese dinero para Educación y acceso a prevencion de reproduccion sexual desde los 13 años a niñas y niños. El camino a la pobreza en colombia es la reproducion.
- Educacion de universidad gratis para todos los estratos. Estipendo de ayuda economica salario minimo manteniendo 80% promedio para STEM ( Ciencia, Tecnologia, Ingenieria, Matematica)."

1202,"Como dicen u/Perro_amarillo y u/criloz en sus comentarios.... Las fuerzas antimotines son comunes, si las quitan los militares o policías armados serán los que tomen su lugar... Lo que hay que hacer es cambiar a su jefe (que actualmente es el gobierno central)...  Cada gobierno local debería tener su fuerza pública ajustada a su necesidad... Con eso pasan 2 cosas

1. Es más fácil que localmente de manera democrática se reforme cada entidad policial de la región

2. Es más fácil responsabilizar al gobierno local que al nacional"
1203,"Desmontar al Esmad ¿para qué? ¿para que ahora sean fuerzas militares y policiales que no tienen ningún entrenamiento en antidisturbios, las que estén en las protestas? Eso significaría muchos más muertos y violaciones de DDHH.

O desmontar al Esmad para crear otro Esmad con otro nombre, hacer la del bobo, cambiarlo todo para no cambiar nada.

No sé a qué se refiere con que los grupos policiales antidisturbios no se ven en  países ""civilizados"". Precisamente las fuerzas antidisturbios se inventaron en países desarrollados."

1207,"Yo antes era anarquista,  ahora soy minarquista, el anarquismo  solo funciona si todos los países del mundo lo fuesen, pero eso nunca va a pasar además   se necesitan las fuerzas militares.  Colombia lo que si necesita es descentralizarse y pasarle más poder a las regiones, posiblemente dividir la figura del presidente en dos, un jefe de estado  que sería elegido de forma directa y un jefe de gobierno que sería elegido por la cámara y el senado,  así es mucho más fácil que el país se ha gobernado mediante consensos y se pase rápida las legislaciones. 

 Pero lo único que va a sacar a Colombia del atolladero es volverse indispensable en el comercio mundial, dejar de solo exportar cosas sin valor agregado, petróleo, café, flores, etc.  Y aprovechar la posición geográfica  que tenemos,  volvernos un centro de logística para Latinoamérica,  un puente entre USA y Brasil que están entre las 7 más grande economía del mundo."
1208,"El primer paso debería ser reducir el Estado, reducir el número de congresistas y representantes de cámara, tenemos que? Como doscientos setenta y punta? Es injustificable y de ahí se pierde mucho dinero y además da oportunidades a más eventos de corrupción y es más difícil de investigar y judicializar debido a la cantidad de acusaciones solo por persona. También se debería reducir el sueldo de los funcionarios públicos, específicamente del congreso, un senador no debería tener un sueldo tan alto por el sencillo hecho de que no es una posición a la cual se deba aspirar por su recompensa monetaria. 

Con solo esos primeros pasos el Estado empezará a recuperar algo de dinero y no tendremos que estar al borde de la bancarrota cada semestre."
1209,"No soy anarquista esencialmente porque creo que hay temas y problemas en lo político que no pueden ser simplemente resueltos desde lo civil, un poco como la pregunta que hace caes95 sobre la justicia; creo que aún si una sociedad lograra volverse anarquica, eventualmente surgiría una estructura que haría las veces de Estado
Sobre el problema de los políticos y su interés de aumentar su poder, por eso creo que la ciudadanía debe estar más organizada: los contrapesos no deben ser solamente entre instituciones del Estado sino entre la sociedad y ese Estado
Por último, no creo que la ""derecha"" y la ""izquierda"" quieran ambas ampliar el Estado: la derecha busca el Estado más mínimo, que permita el desarrollo económico privado, globalizado, mientras la izquierda si está más interesada en fortalecer un Estado que tenga un papel más dinámico"

Y sin duda, no podemos dejarlo tampoco quieto mientras fortalecemos la ciudadanía: hay que trabajarle a todo de forma simultánea.
Mi inquietud es que estamos tan enfocados en pensar leyes, pero no en las instituciones y el tejido social necesario para que sean efectivas: por ejemplo, la Constitución establece que el derecho a la vida es inviolable, no hay pena de muerte, hay un montón de aparatos legales e institucionales para velar por esto, pero culturalmente somos tan violentos que igual andamos en la calle con cuidado porque ""no sabemos quién es el otro""; eso no se resuelve con más policía, ni con penas más severas sino con construcción de tejido social, con un cambio cultural. Si, desde arriba, desde la política, también se puede promover esos cambios, pero me gustaría que nos pensemos qué podemos hacer desde nuestra esfera de influencia como ciudadanos, como individuos"

Claro, la corrupción y la mala administración corre por cuenta de los políticos, pero eso es un fenómeno social, no natural: no son corruptos simplemente por ser colombianos.
Lo que creo es que en estos otros estados la sociedad civil es más fuerte, no simplemente que la gente esté más enterada, sino que hay iniciativas civiles que ayudan a construir identidad, tejido social y veeduría a los políticos; eso nos falta acá, y eso nos toca construirlo a nosotros"
1214,"Pareces desconocer que la misma Constitución prohíbe la pena de muerte, y que ese tipo de castigos no son más que populismo punitivo, como la dichosa cadena perpetua a violadores. Sin  duda se necesita una reforma a la justicia, pero la imposición de penas más severas no sirve"

1220,"Yo creo que más que pensar alternativas al ESMAD es que este realmente funcione como debería: primero que todo, respetando sus propios protocolos, y segundo, que no se despliegue constantemente para todo y sobre todo para sabotear manifestaciones.   
Aparte de eso, no como alternativa al ESMAD sino como estrategias antes de recurrir al ESMAD, sería importante que los gobiernos locales pudieran tener una comunicación más efectiva con los organizadores de marchas y ayudarles a establecer... ""controles internos""? que les permitan a los mismos manifestantes evitar los vandalismos en las protestas"
1221,"Ninguna. Los países civilizados no utilizan escuadrones antimotines, es una salvajada latina que sólo sirve para provocar a los manifestantes.

Si hay una reduccion en ese gasto pues no sabemos que pasara con esa platica porque igualmente en el estado corrupto todo ese dinero no se va reedigir a sectores que se necesiten.

En un mundo ideal que se cumpla que las ramas del poder público sean verdaderamente independientes. Que el presidente no este poniendo a cargo a sus amigos porque genera acumulacion de poder.

Luego pensando en las necesidades de las personas es necesario que la educacion publica superior sea un acceso obligatorio a los de menor recursos. No con esos programas de ser pilo y paga o icetex que genera desercion.

1225,"Brevemente, no creo que reducir el congreso sea necesariamente positivo: reducir el congreso favorece a los partidos políticos grandes y a las maquinarias además de que reducen la representación de las minorías en el legislativo. En cuanto a los salarios, no sé todo lo que tengan los congresistas, pero tampoco podemos pretender reducirles el salario tanto que prácticamente haya que pagar para ser congresista: ahí si que se complica la corrupción. Y tampoco eso va a ""financiar"" al país.

La ""izquierda"" imponiendo el progresismo aparte de su intervencionismo  económico y la ""derecha"" aparte de su conservadurismo social ahora (por lo menos en Colombia) también con intervención economica y pues su nacionalismo proteccionista...

Ahora yo considero que los términos derecha e izquierda sólo logran poner a la gente una contra otra... Creo que la discusión más productiva se da desde el marco de ""los que quieren dejar a la gente en paz"" y ""los que no quieren dejar a la gente en paz""... Así nos daremos cuenta que no es los fachos contra los comunistas, sino la gente contra los políticos ladrones.

El anarquismo en el estado actual es inviable eso lo reconozco... Por eso digo que soy ideologíamente anarquista, sin embargo creo que debe ser una meta a la cual, con el tiempo, nos acerquemos cada día más. Y entender que la existencia del estado condiciona su crecimiento... Si creemos que el estado tiene legitimidad por principio y para siempre  terminaremos agrandandolo inevitablemente"
1227,"Pues como digo, ideológicamente es la idea pragmáticamente, si desmontamos el estado hoy, mañana amanecermos con uno nuevo. Antiguamente la justicia funcionaba con arbitrajes privados (así es como un partido de fútbol), los árbitros que tuvieran fama de ser justos e imparciales ganarían fama y  serían contratados de manera más frecuente.

En cuanto a cómo llegamos allá? Lo primero sería fragmentar el poder del estado, eso significaría federalizar Colombia, si cada región gana independencia es más difícil que un tirano corrompa todo el país de un solo golpe, lo siguiente sería reducir el poder del estado central eliminando ministerios o fucionandolos, esto les gustaría a los de izquierda porque la policía dejaria de ser problema del ministerio de defensa y sería problema de gobernaciones o alcaldías locales"

Con esto si no estoy de acuerdo... Las drogas SI DEBERÍAN SER LEGALES, pero que las personas de a pie sean las que decidan si quieren o no entrar en ese negocio, el estado lejos del mercado, si comienzan a meterse en eso es dejar que el peor cartel de todos ( el estado) se meta en el negocio.

1252,"Resumen(45%) automatico del texto 'La estrategia oculta del Comité del Paro'.

 SEMANA conoció que este jueves, en Cali, hubo una reunión entre el Comité del Paro nacional, el Comité de Paro del Valle del Cauca y algunos integrantes de los llamados puntos de resistencia.

 Allí se acordó una detallada estrategia para alargar las protestas de manera indefinida, pese a la crisis humanitaria y de desabastecimiento en algunas regiones del país y los polémicos bloqueos.

 El primero plantea que el paro hay que ""Repotenciarlo con la acción unitaria de masas del próximo 19 de mayo"".

 En el segundo se habla de la negociación con el Gobierno nacional como una ""táctica"" y dejan claro que hay que plantear ""Las líneas rojas en torno a las garantías para la movilización y la protesta social como precondicionamientos y la participación de sectores que van más allá del CNP"". En el tercer punto del acuerdo proponen un ""Fortalecimiento"" con la incorporación de nuevos sectores sociales y populares, ""Proyectando pliegos regionales"", lo cual claramente alargaría cualquier conversación que pueda darse.

 Aunque el Comité del Paro no le ha contado al país sobre su nueva estrategia, hoy se filtró a los medios de comunicación y generó una gran alarma por el impacto que puedan seguir teniendo estas protestas y bloqueos en la vida de millones de colombianos.

Miralo así, ¿crees que las FARC y el gobierno de Santos hubieran llegado a un acuerdo de no ser porque los diálogos se llevaron se hicieron en Cuba, que sirvio de territorio neutral?

1295,"De acuerdo con los otros posters. Por ejemplo en mi caso la pandemia pegó duro y unas semanas antes del paro pude volver a trabajar. Empezó el paro y nos tocó dejar de ir. Yo debo atravesar la ciudad de sur a norte y uso el mío para eso. También está que el precio de los alimentos subió exageradamente y lo que antes te alcanzaba para dos días ( hablo del dinero) ya no alcanza sino para una sola comida para 4. En Siloe hay personas que están sin insulina por ejemplo y no tienen cómo movilizarse para ir a reclamar o por lo que no hay paso no está llegando la medicina. Yo hoy fui a reclamar mi medicina y había gente que no le pudieron dar completo porque no habían podido pasar los camiones.  Aquí a todos nos está afectando esta situación , no es cuestión del encierro como dicen muchos , es cuestión de que están afectando al resto del pueblo con esos bloqueos y daños a diferentes partes. En mi sector hay ya 3 panaderías y varios restaurantes que durante pandemia pudieron sobrevivir pero que por el paro ya tuvieron que cerrar porque se quedaron sin materia prima."
1296,"Vivo en el sur de Bogotá y trabajo en el norte y la verdad aquí todos o la gran mayoría de trabajadores viven en el norte y uno los ve muy relajados, por más que intenten evitar que la gente llegue a su trabajo no lo han podido lograr y lo único que están haciendo es afectarnos a quienes nos toca atravesar la ciudad de un extremo a otro tanto para salir a nuestro lugar de trabajo como después de una larga jornada tener que llegar mamados caminando porque los desocupados están bloqueando las calles y saboteando, en ese orden de ideas digo que es una cosa inútil el joder las clases bajas y trabajadoras y que las personas que están por el norte siguen haciendo sus vidas como si nada pasara, es más aquí se habla de paro mañana pero en la oficina no les interesa nada y pues muchos van a venir porque aquí en el norte nadie viene a joder a esta gente, nos están es fastidiando a nosotros loa clase baja y nos siguen jodiendo para llegar a nuestra casa."
1297,Primero la pandemia y ahora el paro. Hay gente que necesita ir a trabajar para darle de comer a su familia para pagar la renta y más cosas de necesidad. Hay gente enferma que necesita movilizarse y medicina. El paro fue muy mal organizado y solo está  afectando a las comunidades de bajos recursos.

Y bueno, si necesitamos para el subsitir diario, pero eso es una solución a corto plazo, pregunto yo, ¿Qué pasaría si  ya no lo necesitan a uno más? Lo más factible es que lo desechan y uno se queda sin nada. Ahí, entonces,  cambiaría la cosa, entonces, independientemente que afecte de manera sustancial muchas cosas del diario vivir, lo importante es saber que si queremos que esa desigualdad no se perpetúe más, toca obligar el cambio, tanto primero en uno, y luego en los demás. Porque si perpetuamos la desigualdad ahora con nosotros, nuestros futuros hijos, sufrirán lo mismo y se continúa el ciclo."
1301,"Si, es normal. Hay personas que necesitamos trabajar. Esos bloqueos que se estan haciendo en las ciudades solo es un ""tiro en la rodilla"" a la misma clase media-baja. Los politicos, a los que se les quiere mandar en mensaje, estan en sus fincas o fuera del pais. El bloquear una calle no va a traer a los martires caidos, y tampoco va a traer el peso de la ley a los responsables. Hacer que el metro o el transmilenio dejen de funcionar solo afecta a jovenes y clase trabajadora. Hay formas mas inteligentes de protestar y enaltecer sus memorias: como votar masivamente en el 2022, usar mecanismos democraticos como referendums, consultas, plebiscitos, entorpecer campañas electorales, y enviar las pruebas necesarias a los entes indicados para que se judicialicen los culpables. Se que hablar es muy facil...Pero esos bloqueos son muy desgastantes para el mismo pueblo."

Se lo digo yo que trabajo, tengo una mamá que necesita medicinas y atención médica constantemente y protesto.
La cosa es que esto no cambia si nadie pone nada de su parte. Ahora usted no marcha, no aguanta ni balas no bolillasos, ni siquiera aguanta el esfuerzo físico que implica salir a marchar.

¿Conocés qué es la Navaja de Ockham?

> *«en igualdad de condiciones, la explicación más sencilla suele ser la más probable»*

Es decir, seguramente son protestantes. Las protestas no son iniciativas con un liderazgo claro. Pueden haber muchos buenos y unos pocos mal intensionados. Eso se vió muy claro en los primeros días que mucha gente se entró a robar a los almacenes de cadena en Cali (mientras otros devolvian artículos robados que eran recuperados por la misma población)"
1322,"probablemente, las personas cuya forma de protestar es violenta, no tienen como objetivo carros particulares ni en general cosas que pueda afectar al pueblo, posiblemente sea alguien tratando de deslegitimizarlo"
1323,"Son los delincuentes Indígenas que llegaron desde el Departamento de El Cauca para delinquir en Cali,"
1324,"Si esto x100, piense op de que sirve tirarle rocas a un carro para la protesta ? La unica posibilidad que le diria oiga tal vez son protestantes es si sus padres manejan una Toyota blanca, porque digamos que representan a la 'gente de bien', pero si no, son seguramente infiltrados para deslegitimar la protesta"
1325,"Repuesta un poco irrelevante acá, pero posiblemente interesante: la navaja de Occam no es necesariamente una buena heurística. 

En vez de explicaciones sencillas, una alternativa es buscar explicaciones que son difíciles de variar (explanations that are hard to vary). Por ejemplo, parafraseando The beginning of infinity, una explicación que los griegos tenían para las estaciones era que cada año Perséfone tenía un tiempo en el cual podía salir del Hades, y que eso se expresaba en los cambios de temperatura. Esa explicación es sencilla si la comparamos con la explicación que las estaciones son debidas a la inclinación del eje de rotación de la tierra. Pero es una explicación fácil de variar: podemos cambiar Perséfone y Hades por Zeus y el Olimpo, o por la llegada del niño Dios en Diciembre. En cambio, en la explicación de la inclinación del eje de rotación, no podemos tan fácilmente cambiar el ángulo de inclinación, la velocidad de rotación de la tierra o demás parámetros: si cambiamos los parámetros, la explicación no se va a ajustar a las observaciones que hacemos sobre el clima en la tierra. Con las explicaciones difíciles de variar, lo que encontramos son explicaciones que dependen menos del contexto, y que permiten hacer predicciones más precisas.


Ahora volviendo al contexto de las protestas, posiblemente una mejor heurística a utilizar que la navaja de Occam, es la de buscar explicaciones difíciles de variar (no me pregunté cómo, yo solo estoy haciendo bien apunte irrelevante)"
1326,"Y por la respuesta que acaba de dar ya me doy cuenta la clase de realidad que quiere ver... Esa respuesta que en boca de un uribista es «excusas para zafarse de responsabilidad» pero en un «joven que reclama sus derechos» es una verdad incuestionable... Ponen el escenario para que pasen estas cosas y luego tienen la audacia de culpar a otros... Las manifestaciones y protestas SI tienen liderazgos, si no lo tienen es caos y vandalismo puro, dejen de excusarse por querer un espacio para soltar el mandril interno, están igualitos a los tombos abusivos justificando lo injustificable."
1327,"Te di un voto, aunque no estemos de acuerdo, porque estás aportando constructivamente a la discusión.

Te explico porqué no estamos de acuerdo.

Creo que has mal interpretado lo qué implica la navaja de Ockham.

> una mejor heurística a utilizar que la navaja de Occam, es la de buscar explicaciones difíciles de variar 

Estos dos principios no son contradictorios ni mucho menos mutuamente excluyentes. Es decir: una explicación simple no significa que puede estar sujeta a variaciones; tampoco significa que una explicación díficil de variar es necesariamente compleja.

El ejemplo de las estaciones y los dioses griegos, **NO** es un ejemplo de navaja de Ockham. Todo lo contrario. La explicación de cualquier fenómeno a traves de entidades ficticias NO son por ende simples. **No hay que confundir simples (falto de complejidad) con simplista (ingénuo), como es el caso de creer en dioses o explicaciones carentes de evidencia.**"
1328,"Me refería a que no tienen un líder o una cabeza impartiendo órdenes de marcha. Aunque tienen líderes no tienen una *cadena de mando*

Sí un joven decide tirar una piedra a un carro, no tiene nada de extraordinario."
1329,"Lo que quería mostrar con el ejemplo es que la navaja de Occam puede motivar a alguien a encontrar una explicación linguisticamente simple. El ejemplo de los dioses sólo se complejiza si comenzamos a agregar detalles sobre la naturaleza de los dioses en la explicación. La explicación con el ángulo de rotación tambien se puede complejizar una vez comenzamos a agregar detalles (por ejemplo, tratando de explicar porqué la tierra tiene ese eje de rotación).

La navaja de Occam nos dice que no deberíamos incluir dettalles irrelevantes, pero no dice cuando detenerse con los detalles. Decidir cuando un detalle es irrelevante queda a juicio propio (motivado por la dificultad computacional, o simplemente por estética).

Yo no quise dar a entender que la navaja de Occam y el principio de Deusthch de las explicaciones dificiles de variar fueran contradictorios o excluyentes. A lo que quería llegar es a que, con el principio de explicaciones dificiles de variar, el objetivo de la explicación es más claro y funcional: se busca una explicación que se pueda generalizar a nuevas observaciones y contextos, sin tener que ajustarla. En cambio, el objetivo de la navaja de Occam es la simplicidad en si misma."
1330,"Osea que el Comité del Paro, los lideres estudiantiles, los lideres comunitarios y los coordinadores de las marchas son teoría conspirativa o decoración... Eso que usted dice es una necedad, las marchas TODAS son organizadas, planeadas y coordinadas, no son hechas al azar ni producto de un egregor. La existencia de una cadena de mando NO IMPIDE que haya gente haciendo pendejadas sin órdenes, que el ser humano no es una hormiga ni un robot. Hasta entre fuerzas armadas pasan esas cosas, si un soldado quiere usar su arma LO VA A HACER y se enfrenta a las consecuencias haya o no recibido ordenes de hacerlo... Cuando la gente no entiende cómo funciona el poder y su relación con la Voluntad humana se cree esas excusas de cadenas de mando y organización premeditada de actos individuales.

Y antes que lo diga: La unica razón por la que un soldado que abre fuego sin orden es un crimen, y un marchante tira piedras sin una cadena de mando detrás es «normal», se debe a que a la marcha social en Colombia no la tieneb regulada Y NO LA QUIEREN REGULAR, precisamente porque tienen la loca idea que protestar es salir a quemar todo y que por arte de magia se solucione un problema (La misma lógica del abusador en una relación, cree que con golpear cosas se le va a arreglar la vida por arte de magia y la excusa «estoy emputado» lo exime de responsabilidad o carga moral) y porque, le voy a dar el dato, la marcha social en este país solo sirve para mantener los animos caldeados y que las élites puedan fidelizar sus rebaños electorales y afianzar la mentalidad de borrego en el pueblo... Un pueblo emputado NO PIENSA... Dos siglos y no notan el patrón???"
1331,"Eso no es una cadena de mando. 

Un cadena de mando es lo que tiene un ejército. Una persona da una orden y todos bajo su mando acatan.

Una protesta, un grupo de manifestantes, no tienen eso (La excepción es la minga. Pero la minga y los manifestantes no es lo mismo.)"
1332,"Entonces le reitero, usted lo que está diciendo es que tooooda esa gente que organiza el paro son unos pintados en la pared y que las protestas no tienen control... Y con ese argumento se quejan del ESMAD, que existe PRECISAMENTE para controlar turbas fuera de control? Basicamrnte acaba de decir que los marchantes son una banda de anarquistas sin ton ni son... Cuando la realidad es todo lo contrario... En el ejercito, por cierto, un general da una orden y esta se transmite a toda la cadena, los ejecutores tienen plena libertad de acción en tanto comsigan el objetivo, desde un «Capturen elemento X» hasta «Vuelen un oleoducto y luego embosquen a los que vengan a arreglarlo para capturar el objetivo» hay una diferencia propia de lo que usted dice que NO es una cadena de mando. Le repito, policías y soldados también pueden ir a hacer lo que les de la gana, no son robots ni hormigas y eso no anula la existencia de una cadena de mando. Igual que los marchantes. Todo es un tema de orden, ojo con esas concepciones, si el paro no tiene orden y es caos entonces es una amenaza para el bienestar de Colombia, basicamente justificando que los agreda la policía y la ciudadanía misma. Ojo pues, que yo se que esto no es lo que quiere decir, pero es lo que está diciendo sin darse cuenta."
1333,"Una protesta no tiene cadena de mando que cubra todos los manifestantes. 

No te lo puedo explicar más conciso que eso. Busca que significa cadena de mando si no me entiendes."

1346,"Pues mira:
primero en el comité del paro hay generalizando un poco exmiembros de guerrillas como las farc y personas que buscan instaurar un régimen comunista. (ejemplos de regímenes comunistas son Cuba y Venezuela)

Segundo el tema del robo es en parte culpa del propio colombiano que pide más subsidios que tienen que ser sacados de los impuestos de los colombianos, eso significa más impuestos es igual mayores recursos administrados por el estado lo que es igual a más corrupción. 

Tercero teniendo esto en cuenta el comité del paro no busca hacer mucho bien ya que entre todo lo que piden es más subsidios y sabemos que significa esto.

Solución posible
Podría ser eliminar la mayor cantidad de subsidios posibles para disminuir lo impuestos así dejar de poner tantos recursos en las manos del estado y con respecto al comité de paro disolver esto por que si lees sus aproximadamente 104 puntos ellos dicen que son trece pero son 104 son completamente inviables, además ellos son en parte los culpables de todo el vandalismo que llego con el paro por que por encima no pero en el fondo son igual de corruptos que nuestros políticos .

Por ultimo deberíamos no pedir comprensión y subsidios y menos impuestos, sino libertad las personas no recibirán más subsidios (que por cierto ellas mismas pagan con los impuestos ) sino que tendrán más dinero a su disposición ya que los impuestos bajan por que no habra subsidios que necesiten impuestos lo que también disminuye la corrupción por último reabrir el país porque está reforma es para pagar la deuda externa los subsidios y todo el dinero que se desperdició durante esta pandemia nunca debimos cerrar el país eso hizo más mal que bien.

Y para colmos, quieren hacer campaña política con la sangre de los muertos. Donde está la oposición? Lastimosamente, los de derecha nos tiran a matar, y los de izquierda se vuelven espectadores, mientras el pueblo se desangra."
1358,"> Crear un Estado mas grande (más políticos, más empleados públicos = más corrupción) que administre esos subsidios que se tendrán que sacar de impuestos... o imprimir más pesos, para luego usarlos como materia prima de bolsos y carteras.

Bueno entonces ve a hacer paro y pidete un nuevo subsidio que saldrá de un préstamo internacional qu como no queremos pagar con más impuestos terminaremos como Venezuela con tantos subsidios que no podremos subsanar nuestra deuda externa.
1361,"Claro pero cerrar el país es mejor que no dejar que la economía se autodestruya conozco la gravedad del covid pero al menos tienes la más mínima idea de que tanto creció nuestra deuda internacional por todos los subsidios que se entregaron durante el aislamiento, aislamiento que sólo pudo subir los índices de pobreza 7 puntos no se de donde eres pero si lo único que buscas es desinformar, hablar y desinformar sin fuentes los mentirosos y estúpidos como tu mantienen a la gente en la pobreza debes entender que vivo, no, vivimos en un país pobre nosotros no podemos esperar solucionar nuestra situación con subsidios que mira como funcionó de bien en Venezuela."

We need to pay this aid and we don't want to aid other countries, what everyone needs is realize that our problem is not only taxes, police brutality and corruption, because your super Canadian economic aid is not everything that a country need in order to avoid or solve its problems.
We have a heavy problem that could become in a civil war the people who is against the government and the government that want to put more taxes we have illegal military groups that grow really fast and all you bunch of assholes will pay for all your misunderstandings, lies and fallacies with the inonts blood and Lives, more of they you don't deserve any respect."

1375,"Su observación toca el punto más delicado de cualquier programa social que pudiera hacer cualquier gobierno. ¿A dónde se va el dinero? No basta solo con crear programas, se necesita un control muy fuerte sobre los gastos. Mientras la corrupción no se ponga bajo control en este país, cualquier programa del gobierno está condenado a funcionar a medias o a no funcionar en absoluto.

Pero tristemente estamos en el país que no quiso votar mayoritariamente por la consulta anti-corrupción, que no era perfecta, pero era un paso en la dirección correcta."
1376,"En primer lugar nisiquiera debería haber un ""comité de paro"" eso ya es de por sí burocrático. Hay mucha contradicción. No quieren una reforma que pretende recaudar unos 28 billones pero exigen peticiones que cuestan 83 billones."
1377,El comité de paro siempre listos para decepcionarnos y desaaprovechar oportunidades históricas
1378,"La pregunta es ""quienes son los del comite del paro"", alguien sabe quienes son estos?, la misma pregunta me hacia yo sobre estas ""propuestas"" que no solucionan el problema principal y por curiosidad me pregunte, y quien diablos es este Comite?, buscar en inet no da respuestas, so...no hay ningun medio que informe quienes son, ni siquiera los de las cadenas del regimen tienen esa info expuesta."
1379,"Muy inteligente su observación. Efectivamente, viniendo de uno de esos países 'ricos', la gente aqui no se da cuenta lo duro que uno tiene que trabajar en esos países, lo alto que son los impuestos, lo poco se puede hacer 'en negro' (por eso también solemos ser menos simpaticos también). Aqui en Colombia los impuestos también son altos, pero muy pocos los pagan. El otro día lei que la mitad de la población ni siquiera DECLARA renta, y que solo 4% (!!!!) de la poblacion efectivamente PAGA impuesto de renta. Si muestras esta cifra a un europeo, flipa. Obviamente la solución pasará por sueldos mas altos, pero para tener sueldos más altos, la productividad también tendrá que aumentar, es decir menos puestos de trabajo pero mejor pagados, pero con más presion de trabajo y menos 'libertad/flexibilidad'. Pero bueno, la situación como está ahora algun día tendra que cambiar."
1380,"El Comité del Paro son los mismos políticos, es decir, imaginen una revuelta de corderos contra lobos, pero los representantes de la revuelta son otros lobos ¿Entienden?"
1381,"Hay que entender que un pliego de peticiones no es un programa de gobiernos. De hecho, creo que el pliego es ingenuo por lo amplio que es. Ahí hay cosas en las que nos demoraríamos décadas, y que además tienen que ser escogidas por los colombianos en las urnas.

Y eso sin entrar a examinar la representatividad o legitimidad del famoso comité..."
1382,"Creo que debe girar en 3 ejes y los enumeró: 

Reducir la corrupcion, y hacer que la gobernabilidad sea más rápida.

Atender con ayudas sociales a las partes de la sociedad que lo necesitan ,pero el subsidio debe permitirles trabajar de hecho deberían para que el que lo reciba, debe tener actos que está luchando para salir de esa zona de riesgo.

Y el tercer punto reducir las excepciones tributarias que tienen muchas áreas industriales.

Pero se que estos temas con los gobernantes que existen (derecha, izquierda, centro) no van a ponerse de acuerdo, les pregunto es muy descabellada la idea de una Constituyente y así se reforman todos esos puntos directamente...

Saludos"
1383,"No sabía que el paro tenía un comité... 

Dónde se puede ver el pliego de peticiones?"
1384,De buenas a primeras me surgen tres preguntas: quienes conforman ese comité? Quien los eligió? Por qué no piden la renuncia del ministro de defensa?
1385,Y ¿qué propuestas tiene usted para combatir la corrupción? Eso no es tan fácil como decir que los servidores públicos firmen algún papel al posesionarse.
1386,Y cuál es el porcentaje de afiliacion sindical en Noruega y cuanto pagan los bancos? Pregunto por un amigo
1387,"Me parece hasta peor que la misma reforma tributaria hundida ese pliego. 

Los Colombianos tienen que pensar no solo en bajar impuestos, sino en quitar enlaces de codependencia con el estado. 

Eso claramente implica frenar programas sociales, y dejar esos asuntos descentralizados y realmente en manos del pueblo, sin formalismos, sin mordidas, sin chanchullo."
1388,¿Qué tiene de malo?
1389,Ese comité está conformado solo por tibios
1390,Me dolio tanto cuando se hundio esa consulta! Aqui se necesitan medidas anti-corrupcion urgentes.
1391,"La consulta fue ampliamente aprobada por la gran mayoría de los votantes.

Es mentira que no haya Sido la mayoría que dijo si. Fue las trabas que la misma corrupción le puso como el de exigir un número irrisoriamente alto considerando el histórico de votantes incluso en votaciones presidenciales. Suele a toda la propaganda politica que se le hizo a qué ""no hace falta"""
1392,"Y sin comité, o representación central, para qué el paro? Parar por parar?"
1393,de buena...quienes son los del comite del paro?
1394,"Con respecto a la declaracion de renta, quizas el mayor 'pero' es que se requiere pagar un contador, lo cual puede ser un costo considerable para una persona cuyo salario es de $2.500.000 mensuales. Pondre el ejemplo de Noruega otra vez, la declaracion de renta se hace a traves de un aplicativo web super facil de llenar, y no se requiere de intermediarios para nada. 

De hecho, en un sistema ideal, todos deberiamos declarar renta, con el fin de que el Gobierno tenga datos suficientes para saber quien debe pagar impuestos y quien debe recibir subsidios. Pero es esa corrupcion la que no nos deja progresar."
1395,"Es verdad. 

En Colombia la gente no quiere pagar impuestos, así deba hacerlo y tenga con qué. Yo trabajé haciendo ese recaudo y tuve que escuchar cada cosa, varias veces me quisieron ""untar la mano"" para desaparecer la cuentica... pedimos unos políticos y un gobierno menos corrupto y en nuestro día a día hacemos esto."
1396,Y lastimosamente…ese pliego no va a solucionar nada. Solo va a hacer más grande un Gobierno por el que se está protestando.
1397,"Parce, estoy totalmente de acuerdo contigo. No se, no me genera confianzan una constituyente con los personajes que hay en este momento. Pero es un ""boton nuclear"" que se debe considerar."

1402,"Aunque las propuestas sociales que propone son muy ambiciosas y necesarias, no se tocan temas relacionados a la corrupcion, que en ultimas es una de las razones por las que Colombia esta mal."
1403,"El gran problema es que esa consulta tiene que venir de los ciudadanos, por autogestión. Como podemos confiar en que un gobierno con un historial de corrupción no vaya a utilizar esta consulta para legitimarse y excusar su actuar corrupto en el futuro? Sobretodo con un gobierno centralizado como el de Colombia."

1407,"Muy interesante lo que dices, ojalá llegáramos a eso, pero la corrupción..."
1408,Para la declaración de renta en Colombia no se requiere contador. Se puede hacer por uno mismo y también hay aplicativo web. También hay aplicaciones que le hacen a uno la declaración por 60.000 pesos o menos
1409,"Se hace más grande al estado, no al gobierno. La diferencia es importante"
1410,Gracias!
1411,"Esa consulta no iba a tener mucho efecto. El sistema comienza a corromperse en las elecciones, de maneras que no pueden realmente controlarse desde adentro de un gobierno elegido. 

Una mejor opción que la consulta anticorrupción para combatir la corrupción es hacer una reforma electoral, que asegure una mejor representación de la ciudadanía."
1412,"Jajajaja, la consulta que una tercera parte era inconstitucional, otra ya estaba implementada desde antes y el resto no servía para acabar con la corrupción?"

1422,No era perfecta...pero es un buen inicio.
1423,"Entonces con quien nos deberiamos comparar? Con Venezuela? Alla tambien hay un Estado de Bienestar soportado por una dictadura. El problema de Colombia es la corrupcion tan impresionante en todas y cada una de las instituciones del pais. Eso que cuentas del grupo Aval es muestra de que el sistema esta mal, entonces, porque no aparece en el pliego de peticiones? Estamos hablando de un proyecto de 80 billones de pesos del que ""nadie sabe de a donde se va a sacar la plata.""

No entendi tu punto sobre los sindicatos. Un sindicato Noruego participa activamente de la politica, de hecho, tienen partidos politicos, y se reunen periodicamente con el Gobierno. Aqui los sindicatos solo se limitan a hacer marchas, pero no hay cambios de fondo. Cuantos referendums, plebiscitos han convocado los sindicatos en Colombia? Y son las dos caras de la moneda, los unos no hacen nada, los otros por intentar hacer los matan."

1458,"> Fueron siete las peticiones que se incluyeron en el pliego del Comité del Paro. LR calculó que llevar a cabo tres de ellas tendría un costo fiscal aproximado de $81,5 billones, una cifra que es más de cinco veces el recaudo que buscaría el Ministerio de Hacienda con el nuevo articulado de la reforma tributaria ($14 billones).

Pareciera que no es viable la cosa :("
1459,"Eso es descabellado desde un inicio, pero igual creo que piden eso porque es una negociación y de ahí ceden de parte y parte, igual no creo que vayan a pedir lo básico y ceder terreno en eso , pero puede ser un arma de doble filo, porque van a decir vea lo que piden y todo ese tipo de cosas"

1468,"Total ! Pero como yo lo veo es que el problema de la corrupción y el  del referendo es el mismo. Los colombianos no estamos votamos a conciencia cuando toca. 

Comprar votos es barato porque hay pocos personas que están votando y se puede ganar fácil comprándolos. Qué pasaría si todos votáramos? Que sería inviable comprar tanto voto y comprometer tantos puestos gubernamentales. A los políticos les tocaría convencer a la gente a punta de buenas propuestas. 

Colombia tiene una gran oportunidad cada 4 años de cambiar las cosas y debemos reconocer que el poder no está en la violencia sino en una pinche papeleta."

1478,"Por lo que entiendo un proceso de revocatoria ahorita no asegura que los próximos presidentes, congresistas y senadores sean nuevamente corruptos. Lo único que se me ocurre que puede ayudar es que cada persona de un voto responsable y consiente por un candidato que en verdad los represente en cada una de las próximas votaciones. Así comprar votos se vuelve algo sumamente difícil de hacer porque les saldría muy caro y además los políticos asumirían el puesto comprometidos con propuestas a la gente que le dio el voto (más no gracias a mermelada ya que no alcanzaría a ser viable si todos votáramos)."

1499,"Que tengan semejanzas caudillistas no me parece suficiente para decir que ""son idénticos"". Uno ha ostentado el poder por lo menos por 8 años, y el otro apenas viene agarrando tracción como una figura antagónica (irónicamente, producto de los mismos partidarios de Uribe. De otro modo, se hubiese quedado con el mismo perfil con el que tienen a Cepeda).

Más allá de la cuestionable alcaldía que tuvo, su pasado en el M-19 y su video de las bolsas, la influencia de Petro aún palidece frente a la de Uribe. Sin mencionar que la dimensión de sus escándalos políticos es completamente desigual.

Considero que igualarlos es trivializar una coyuntura política mucho más compleja y que tiene diferentes aristas, y no solo dos polos y un centro (prácticamente la narración maniqueista que sustenta al uribismo en vacas flacas)."
1500,"por qué? ósea no es como si uno tuviera una gigantesca responsabilidad en la situación actual del pais, la corrupción, falsos positivos, que el pais este en manos de los grandes empresarios fanáticos del monopolio, el bipartidismo y la satanización de la izquierda política o cualquiera que piense diferente a el

mientras que el otro es un progresista, que no es corrupto, que no miente y que la única razón de por que les cae mal es por que el uribismo supo como manchar su reputación, porque no, Petro y Uribe son completamente diferentes, no solo en política"

1504,"Frente a la responsabiliad histórica, sin duda estoy con usted. Hay algunas cosas que quedaron pendientes (o cuanto menos sin mencionar) de la administración de Petro en Bogotá (las cuales, sin duda alguna, no se comparan con lo que realizó Uribe). 

Frente a la forma de realizar polítca, y a su forma de administrar, difiero profundamente con usted."
1505,"Petro no sataniza al que piensa diferente a él? wuau primera vez que lo escucho. Según él mismo, se atribuye la creación de algo asi como dos mil quinientos nuevos empleos en Bogotá, claro lo que no dice es incrementó la burocracia y las corbatas, así hasta yo genero 2.500 empleos nuevos (no sostenibles).

 En cuánto al progresismo, el mas famoso de Latinoamérica ha sido Chávez dicho también por el mismo comandante en una de tantas entrevistas en 1998 semanas antes de su elección y luego ratificado por Petro en 2002 (también disponible en YouTube por si acaso) entonces pues ser progresista no es sinónimo de maravilla o que sea el ""cambio"".     

 Colombia no necesita mas Mesías y tristemente el señor Petro se ve así mismo como tal (fuentes disponibles, si las necesitas las busco y te las paso) y decir algo ligeramente negativo de él o mostrarse en desacuerdo con él es ganarse la enemistad de sus huestes. (véase como se expresa Levy Rincón de Daniel Coronel por no ser petrista y no desgastarse en ese debate).

 Adicionalmente Petro no le tiembla la lengua para mentir con relación a sus cifras, véase en su Twitter cuando el mismo se echa flores diciendo que bajo la pobreza dimensional de Bogotá durante su gestión, claro omitió decir que fruto de las regalías de la nación en la década dorada de las materias primas todo el país la bajó? Que es real en lo que el dice? Entonces, cuando la gente dice que Uribe y Petro son lo mismo es porque sienten que son mas  los rasgos que los acercan que los que los alejan, cuál entonces es el motivo para desconocer el sentir de muchos? O más bien por que lo creen o no le creen? O te parece que cuándo el se llena la boca diciendo, YO saqué 8 millones de votos será que el man no dice, coño votaron por mí porque no querían votar por Porky? No, no lo piensa... el man está convencido que el los sacó porque viene de una costilla de Jesus,  bueno eso último no tengo respaldo me dejé llevar.
 Finalmente por que HDP tenemos que votar por X para que no quede Y? Por que HDP nos perdemos de gente buena por eso? Porque  la  gente tiene que votar con miedo o con rabia? O tu crees que el innombrable llegó por qué? Porque la gente tenía rabia estaba podrida de la guerrilla. Las condiciones son similares solo que para el otro lado con un personaje con los mismos rasgos del otro pero de izquierda. Entonces? Para dónde vamos?"
1506,"el peor error que podemos hacer es creer que porque son disidentes son mejores, este gobierno es una mierda y si gobierna la izquierda lo va a hacer igual, este gobierno te mete una reforma tributaria en medio de pandemia como unos hijos de puta y un gobierno de izquierdas tambien te va a subir los impuestos pero con palabras mas bonitas como por ejemplo ""justicia social"" ""renta basica universal"" o ""estado de bienestar"" igual te quieren clavar e igual te quieren robar, misma mierda solo que uno llegó al poder y el otro no"

1509,"Creo medio te bugueaste pero any way
Mire, creo que me exprese mal en varios sentidos, a ver, me dije que no mentía refiriéndome a como lo hace uribe y en general los uribistas, no que inflaba números y se atribuía cosas que el no hizo o que no necesariamente fueron por el, me salte la parte de la comparación jaja
Ahora, hablar de Chávez como progresista... Hasta donde yo se era más socialista pero bueno , en cualquier caso, el man fue un dictador que no supo manejar a Venezuela y jodio en todo lo que se podía joder y hasta más, pero no mms, chavez y Petro son polos opuestos dentro de la izquierda por favor
Por último, quiero agregar que si bien apoyo a Petro sobre los candidatos actuales, obviamente estoy en contra de muchas de sus ideas, pero con los hptas uribistas corruptos y asesinos y con los de centro hipócritas y muchos corruptos, pues Petro es la mejor opcion"

Queman buses, dejan al pobre sin que moverse;
Hacer bloqueos, suben los precios de los alimentos y los pobres no los pueden pagar;
Bloquean calles y la gente no puede trabajar.

1674,"Customer service is not a focus of most businesses here. The excuse is typically cost related, but with limited competition, it's just not a motivating factor. The hassle to open an account at a different bank, plus the restrictions on new accounts, makes existing customers stay. And it's not like the next bank will be any better. Same goes for telecom. Three real providers here, so as long as one isn't significantly worse than the others, none will lose a large number of customers. 

The general Colombian market is heavily focused on price point. I have taught my girlfriend to look at price per gram or price per unit in the grocery store. She's shocked every time she finds a product she used to buy because the total price is lower, but the price per gram/unit is higher than a similar product of a larger pack size. In turn, she's also found that buying a higher quality product (beans for example) results in less waste from throwing out damaged product, plus time saved, so sometimes it's worth it to buy higher quality.

It frustrated me when I first came here, but I have a vehicle, so I've found the locations that have less of a line/wait. For ATM's, I've found the grocery stores with one connected tend to not have a line. I don't have a cédula yet, so entering a bank isn't a problem yet. For cell services, see if you're provider allows you to schedule an appointment online. At least that way you skip the line outside.

In my opinion, the issues in Colombia are nothing compared to the beauty, people and culture. I came from a very far paced, high stress life in the US, and I've decided to let it go and live on ""island time"". It's worked out well so far."
1675,"La burocracia colombiana puede ser muy frustrate. Siempre que voy al banco tengo que armarme de paciencia. Toma muchísimo tiempo y la gente no siempre quiere ayudar. Un servicio terrible, como dices tú.

1677,"Thanks for the detailed response.  I understand that you can't really switch companies to get better service because of lack of choice unfortunately.  But I'm legitimately curious how people hold down a job when these services demand so much time and are only open during the work day. Colombian employers don't seem extra generous with benefits/pay from what I've heard.  Making an appointment doesn't seem like a common option here. Just wondering how people could move apartments or buy a house or something that would require interacting with multiple services without taking a week off of work. 

&#x200B;

I agree that there are many benefits to living here that outweigh this one negative, just was curious about it.  I do appreciate not everyone here being overly concerned about time and efficiency, the US lifestyle is not very empathetic or forgiving and stresses me out too."
1678,"They ask for time off and don't get paid for it. We give up to a half day off without reducing pay for personal issues, but that isn't common. Some employers, especially in agriculture, are absolute tyrants. Many people will have a family member handle it for them. If you think it's bad in the cities, imagine living in a rural community, and having a half day walk, or bus ride that costs about 15% of a days pay to even get to where the service you need is offered."

1700,Pues se veia venir. Yo en cali tengo amigos que eran petristas y ahora quieren votar por la cabal .\_. porque su ciudad se volvio un desastre lol. Lo del paro se extendio demasiado. Creo que el descontrol con alguno de los que protestaban les paso factura. Aunque duque tambien de cierta forma destruyo su partido.
1701,"Me parece que la política de no negociar  por parte del gobierno ha cumplido su propósito, echar por tierra las buenas intenciones de la protesta, si a ello se le suma un comité de paro que no representa a nadie y un montón de revueltas que solo trasmiten desorden y  dejan vandalismo,  podemos decir que estamos igual que al principio o peor. Sí fuera necesario decir quién ganó y quien perdió, tal vez diría que ganó el gobierno, porque la popularidad de sus detractores está por el piso, sin seder mayor cosa, perdió la protesta porque no consigo mayor cosa, y sí dejo múltiples daños que afectan al pueblo, otro perdedor,  mismo que ahora aborrece la protesta esa misma de la que podría mayor beneficio."
1702,"The results are interesting to follow over time. I think the margin of error for cities outside Bogotá is a bit high at around +-7% for a 95% interval of confidence (it reached almost 10% for the May 18-22 poll). Also, I've always thought they give too much weight to landline polling compared to cellphone polling (almost 2 to 1, a bit less in Bogotá which perhaps may explain the slightly lower margin of error). They explain that they do random simple selection of respondents within homes - the ones who pick up the calls. Now, what are the kind of people that are there to pick a landline call to answer a survey during the day? I believe there is a hidden skew here to consider. 

Putting that aside, I think that people in general right now are disgusted with politics and politians overall. How will that play out during next year's elections? It's too early too know. Nobody came out unscathed of the protests: Claudia López, Fajardo, Peñalosa, Uribe, Duque, the government-dominated Congress and the rest of government institutions. 

What's important in these surveys is to identify tendencies, most rebounds are well within the margins of error. For instance, you can see in the graphic clear waning of Uribe's favorable image over time. That in itself is significant but paired with the idea that people are not willing to sacrifice their freedoms for more security, a historic gap in recent disfavorability/unvorability of the police forces, and an increase in the unfavorability of the armed forces, it seems to me that the Seguridad Democrática doctrine might be slowly dying and that is good for Colombia in the long run, regardless what the election results might be in the short-run. 

Duque's approval/disapproval gap is still abismal. It caught my attention that La Silla Vacía's analysis on his numbers is misleading:

>Después de ese 18 por ciento, al que llegó antes del paro, con el debate de la tributaria, el presidente vuelve a tener el favor de casi un tercio de los encuestados. 

23% approval rate is not even a fourth of the interviewees, much less a third. There's no need to hype him like this. What La Silla Vacía didn't say is that 84% of Colombians believe that things are getting worse - 3% more than in May - which was the toughest month of the strike. Just 10% of the people think that the country is going well and this falls mainly upon the shoulders of the government. I have no doubts that the actions of the government-controlled Congress - whose favorability is in lows not seen since 1994 - affects its overall image, and Fiscalía, Procuraduría, Contraloría and Corte Suprema de Justicia all show worse favorability numbers.

The strike was never going to reach significant reforms of any kind - because of protests' devaluation as a mechanism to achieve true political change and this goverment's own willingness to rectify its course due to popular demand - but it certainly shook things up. It will be fun to see what happens in the months to come."
1703,Donde hicieron esa encuesta en el chico? o en los rosales?
1704,"Esos no es que estén muy bien de popularidad... Además, con gobierno demócrata en El Norte, no hay chance (afortunadamente)."
1705,"Ojalá lo dieran. La única manera de salvar a Colombia es reconstruyendo desde las cenizas. Las instituciones democráticas están corruptas desde la raíz, cortar las ramas no cambiará nada."
1706,"Si, hay algo que muchos no han entendido, si bien Duque es impopular no lo es por falta de medidas zurdas, sino por falta de medidas conservadoras (que fue el sector que lo eligió) en esa medida el será cada vez mas  impopular pero en pro de quien se presente mas conservador y con un discurso que apele mas a la seguridad y el orden.

Muchas personas quieren evitar el desorden de la izquierda y ven a Duque exageradamente blando, lo que afecta su imagen, pero no por las razones que la gente de izquierda creen.

La mayoría de la gente del común solo quiere un poco de mano dura para que sus vidas y sus trabajos vuelvan a la normalidad sin afectaciones.

En tanto se sigan dando estos exabruptos, si bien Duque seguiría mermando, no sería para dar ventaja a la izquierda sino para dejar abierto el nicho a quien se presente con el discurso mas centrado desde el punto de vista conservador.

Muchos celebraban que Colombia había ""despertado"" y no se dieron cuenta que lo que despertaron fue los conservadores que ya se estaban empezando a ir a dormir.

Ahora mismo cada bobada que cometa o Duque o el Alcalde de Calí o el alcalde zurdo de cualquier ciudad importante solo va mejorar la imagen de Cabal y ya quiero ver las estadísticas nuevas de los precandidatos van a estar muy divertidas ya que si bien Petro se presentaba fuerte antes del paro, el ""no sabe no responde"" y el ""voto en blanco"" siguen siendo mas fuertes en los últimos reportes, y creo que ese resultado se va empezar a distribuir hacia la nueva candidata conservadora.

Yo en lo personal que NUNCA he votado a ningún candidato del uribismo, NUNCA, tengo claro en este momento que si la segunda vuelta se da entre Petro y Cabal, me veré en la incomoda necesidad de votar por Cabal ya que me quedó claro que a Petro le interesan estos exabruptos y no le importa el desabastecimiento.

Muy dificil que yo vuelva a votar por Petro nunca mas en la vida."
1707,"La popularidad del gobierno también está por el piso, en este mismo artículo lo expresan:

""Duque mejora poco por encima del margen de error de la encuesta, después de haber llegado a los peores índices de desfavorabilidad de un presidente desde que se empezó la medición, en el gobierno de Andrés Pastrana. """

Y como se explica entonces la creciente impopularidad de Uribe, quien siempre ha sido representante de la ""mano dura""?"
1716,"Sí, pero su interés primordial al no negociar es cuidar la imagen del partido frente a las próximas elecciones."

1718,"Yo creo que si Fajardo llega a segunda vuelta podría ganar, o alguien como el, yo votaría por el, de lo contrario ya decidí que votaré lo mas a la derecha que haya, asi me toque votar por Cabal."
1719,"Vamos a ver Uribe es una figura muy personalista. En algún momento dejará de ser un mesias, eso no significa que la gente vaya a dejar de ser conservadora. Hasta Churchill envejeció mal en su segundo mandato y fue bastante impopular.

La crisis de liderazgo se va resolver con liderazgo. A Uribe la izquierda lo suele sobredimensionar, cuando el solo representó la amalgama de todos los sectores politicos algunos dispares entre si en un momento de terrorismo sin precedentes, sin duda en la actualidad la situación está lejisimos de lo que era en el momento en que Uribe era una gran opción, pero no significa que ante el desorden producido por la izquierda el trabajador no vaya a desear orden..

Uribe no es una teoría económica o social, y su movimiento tampoco es un partido de algún purismo ideológico, tanto es así que hasta tienen ex guerrilleros en sus filas. Hay una nueva generación, gente que ni siquiera vivió el gobierno de Uribe que no por ello hoy tienen que ser personas de ""izquierda"", ""derecha"" o conservadores.

Uribe llegó a la presidencia después de 2 políticos bastante diferentes de el y Samper y Pastrana, Pastrana que era bastante parecido a Duque y Samper que era un zurdo de cabo a rabo, en ese momento la gente se cansó del desorden y el terrorismo y renuncó a las singularidades politicas en pro de un ""guerrero"" que trajera el triunfo.

Hoy en día no tenemos carros bomba o pescas milagrosas, Uribe ha envejecido, pero el desorden exige un poco de mano dura aunque esta mano dura no tenga la misma intensidad que en el 2000, pues hay que recordar que en el 2000 ir por la calle representaba un terrible peligro de morir en un atentado terrorista facilmente (a mi me tocarón como 3 o 4 ataques terroristas en diferentes momentos de mi vida)

Hoy no se da ese peligro, asi que es aceptable que ya no se necesite un discurso tan extremo como el de Uribe, pero el orden sigue siendo prioritario, ya no se necesita un guerrero, pero se necesita firmeza."
1720,Esta es la clase de gente que cree que todos los problemas de Colombia son culpa de Petro.

3. No sé si Petro sea Cocainomano, cada quién su nariz, pero decir que el aumento de expendio de drogas es culpa de los manifestantes es error, obviamente es algo que, al igual que el covid, venía a la alza desde antes del paro.


4. Y si por consumo de ""drogas"" se refiere a la Mariguana, pos, ahí sí se puede ser menos objetivo. Yo, en lo personal, no lo considero una droga como tal. Pero pues, cada quién su pensar respecto a eso.

Aquí tenemos un gobierno favoreciendo principalmente a la élite de su partido; ni siquiera gobierna a favor de todos los que votaron por el candidato de ese partido, ni para la oposición (lo que aqui se tiene como lógico) ni mucho menos lo hace para favorecer a los que no votaron. Se aprovechan y hace caso omiso a que Duque es el presidente de todos los colombianos y eso es lo que sacó a la gente a las calles.

1745,"está todo indexado como para hablar de propaganda, además la deforestación acá es por coca, minería ilegal y en menor medida ganaderos o sembradores de palma, acá no hay plantaciones de soya (al menos del nivel de argentina o brasil)."
1746,"El tema es que el sindicato solo busca beneficio propio y las personas que buscan realmente el beneficio colectivo, han perdido el rumbo, es más se perdió el rumbo directamente de su origen, ""unión de ciudadanos para la defensa de los derechos civiles"".

Se volvio un tema de palanca, que un tema de unión ciudadana desde para ser veedores de los procesos públicos y vulneración de derechos.

Son visto como políticos, no como la representación de la clase obrera o popular del país, estoy seguro que muchas personas que están en el sindicato, son personas que realmente abogan por lo que la gente necesita, pero hay mucha gente, sobretodo los de arriba, que representan el egoísmo humano y de este país.

Ojala en Colombia se observaran las uniones laborales que se ven en Alemania o en Europa."
1747,"La verdad es que la fuente que usted subio es muy poco seria, a diferencia de la respuesta que le dieron, muy bien sustentada con ciencia.

A fin de cuentas la coca son 200,000 hectareas maximo. Cuántas hectareas se deforestan por ganaderia en el país si estamos hablando de al menos 50 millones de cabezas de ganado?"
1748,"La puse porque precisamente porque tiene una serie de links que redireccionan a las páginas donde están los estudios que están indexadas en lugares serios, si quiere mañana me pongo y le copio y le pego cada link (que era lo que quería evitar poniendo el link inicial).

Si son más o son menos no viene al comentario inicial en el que decía que el glifosato me parece menos perjudicial que esperar a que sigan deforestando; obvio es un problema la ganadería, el cultivo de palma entre otras cosas como lo mencione también pero ese no era el tema."
1749,"Siempre he sostenido que en Colombia la gente no sabe de protestas, estamos acostumbrados a agachar la cabeza. La protesta se hace por un corto tiempo y luego quiere que la dejen trabajar, aunque este sufriendo fuentes necesidades. A eso juega el gobierno a que la misma gente, por agotamiento deslegitime la protesta, y pase de ser el verdugo al salvador que restableció el orden  Tal vez en momento determinado se reavive, pero si el colombiano de a pie no entiende que están son cosas de largo aliento y de fuerte inversión no conseguirá nada y seguimos en la situación que estamos. Mi única esperanza es que está situación le pase factura en las urnas a la clase política que nos tiene en las que estamos."
1750,"La pregunta del millón es: Que legitimidad, quien representan los líderes del paro que están a la mesa de negociación.
Sin legitimidad popular no pueden llegar a nada. Duque hace ""damage control"" y no va a negociar nada con gente que no representan a nadie mas que ellos mismos. 
Los que manifestaron contra la reforma tributaria, el verdadero pueblo colombiano no afiliado, hace rato regresó a casa."
1751,"Creo que se lograron muchas cosas que era imposible que sucedieran con este gobierno tan descarado:

1. Replantamiento de la reforma tributaria. Se sabe que el texto original genera descontento social así que les toca pensar bien el nuevo texto que todo el mundo va a estar encima vigilando.
2. Renunció el ministro de hacienda, el viceministro general de hacienda, el alto comisionado para la paz.
3. Matrícula gratuita en el semestre 2021-2 para estratos 1 a 3 (no es mucho pero es algo).
4. Reforma  a la estructura de la policía nacional, el ministerio de defensa, y la estupidez del cambio de color de uniformes y patrullas.
5. La concientización de mucha gente respecto a la necesidad de la educación y vigilancia de la fuerza pública en derechos humanos, que antes no era tema de conversación.
6. El desanmascaramiento del gobierno actual a nivel local e internacional como represor y violador de derechos humanos.
7. Más del 70% de los colombianos apoyó en cierta medida el paro (Mobimetrics), lo que evidencia el despertar social y político de las mayorías, y se naturaliza el exigir al gobierno cumplir un estándar mayor.
8. El fortalecimiento de los grupos políticos de oposición, dada su evidente influencia, que a su vez motivó a poderosos sectores empresariales a preguntarse si apoyar la campaña de los de siempre era necesario.
9. El retiro de algunas armas exesivas en el ESMAD.

Obviamente seguirá la mamadera de gallo, toca esperar hasta las próximas elecciones, quizá el descontento social se sienta en las urnas también, esperaría uno la reducción del ausentismo."
1752,"La verdad no lo veo como fracaso porque no nos dejamos meter las reformas. Carrasquilla renunció y la comunidad internacional se enteró cómo son realmente los que nos gobiernan. Nuestra situación es muy compleja y no podemos pretender cambiar todo en un par de semanas, eso es imposible!  Tenemos que seguir día a día integrando los cambios que queremos ver en nuestra cotidianidad eliminando lo que tanto criticamos en nuestros políticos. Por ejemplo, si estamos cansados de la corrupción, entonces dejemos de sobornar a policías o agentes de tránsito para evitar multas. Si queremos fortalecer nuestra economía, entonces apoyemos a los campesinos y emprendimientos locales. Hay que dejar de vender el voto por un tamal o peor aún, seguir en abstinencia electoral. Hay que dejar de ver los canales que desinforman y manipulan. Hay que revisar cómo sembramos violencia desde nuestras propias acciones y tratar de cambiar eso. Lo que vemos afuera no es más que un  eco de lo que nosotros hacemos."
1753,[removed]
1754,"No consideró que fracasó, todavía hay manifestaciones en varias ciudades, hay encuentros ciudadanos y otras maneras de resistir. No fracasó, la gente se está organizando, se reconoce que la acción de salir a la calle no es suficiente, se están haciendo asambleas, se están creando organizaciones, hay más espacios de diálogo y de educación, hay más voluntad política de la gente, de conocer cómo puedo yo aportar,  qué mecanismos de participación existe, la política no es solo salir a votar y esperar  que los otros hagan, necesitamos que nos involucremos, en el territorio donde habitemos, que seguramente hay muchas problemáticas, bueno desde ahí, empezar, cómo hago una veeduría, cómo hacer una auditoría, qué contratos  se están haciendo, qué políticos no han pasado proyectos, esto es de largo aliento. Me siento muy orgullosa porque el paro sirvió para reconocer que somos muchos los que nos interesa hacia dónde va el país y nuestro futuro. Es el paro más largo qué he visto en mis años."
1755,"El fracaso más grande del paro fue que a sus impulsores Petro y demás líderes lo hicieron con fines políticos, pero ahora que por causa del paro están muriendo cientos de personas, petro tiene miedo que afecte sus aspiraciones electorales."
1756,"La falta de organizacion y exigencias poco realistas para lo que vive Colombia en el momento dan muestra del fracaso del Paro. Me parecio un atentado contra la juventud lo que ha hecho el tal ""comite del paro"" al apropiarse de las manifestaciones y sacar provecho politico con el dolor de los jovenes. Por otra parte, me duele en el corazon calificar a los de la primera linea como ""idiotas utiles,"" pues no fueron tomados en cuenta para las negociaciones, y ellos eran los que ponian la cara. Finalmente, esta forma de protestar, solo dio pie para que gobierno y otros grupos deslegitimizaran la protesta como mecanismo democratico, pues algo que debio ser un llamado a escuchar el pueblo, termino siendo recordado como bloqueos, exceso de fuerza y actos vandalicos.

Edit: como comentario final...Espero y aspiro que este descontento generalizado se vea reflejado en las elecciondes de congreso, senado y presidencia del 2022."
1757,"El paro falló porque al gobierno no le importa los derechos humanos. 

Cuando las mercancías se encuentran estancadas por razones de logística a causa de los paros y bloqueos viales, ese problema es de los ciudadanos causado por los ciudadanos.

El fallo ahí está en el hecho que el paro no afecta al gobierno si no al ciudadano, especialmente al ciudadano de bajos recursos que no representa ninguna amenaza social a la élite del país, o sea los ricos. El gobierno no se responsabiliza de nada, ni en el pasado ni ahora.

La comunidad internacional no se mete, los estados unidos nos meten plata en el bolsillo y la desgracia democrática continúa gracias al lavado de cerebro tan hijueputa que nos han hecho."
1758,"No la clase política no hace que se sienta frustrado eso uno lo hace solito,protestar protestar creo que debería uno protestar contra si mismo sus malas desiciones,su flojera,pero es más sencillo psicológicamente que otro tenga la culpa no yo,de lo que me pasa,Gente hay Covid cuídense y a sus familias, suben los casos por las aglutinamientos de gente de las protestas."
1759,"Totalmente de acuerdo,las reformas ya se callejón,me tomé la libertad de leer lo que pide el comité del paro,y están grande pide alrededor de 132 cosas,que tomarían 5 reformas tributarias para hacerlas,ya que el problema de fondo es que no hay plata."
1760,"No caigas en el mismo error que el gobierno.  Para el gobierno el paro no es legítimo ya y solo lo ve como producto de la intervención de Venezuela/Rusia 🙄 o el llamado electoral de Petro o gente pagada por los narcos, bacrim o guerrilla. Con esta justificación el gobierno hace oídos sordos y cierra la puerta al diálogo. Con esto el gobierno no ve qué los jóvenes que sigue en las calles lo hacen porque siguen teniendo peticiones legítimas. Los jóvenes quedan sin ser escuchados y esto genera más frustración.

El comité del paro no representa a todos los sectores. Eso es bien conocido e incluso lo han dicho ellos. Es responsabilidad del gobierno buscar canales de comunicación con los demás sectores, y si estos no tienen líderes claros, pues es también tarea del gobierno dar espacios y garantizar que estos liderazgos surjan. Por qué es responsabilidad del gobierno? Porque sencillamente para eso es la política."
1761,"Pese a que no estoy de acuerdo con muchos puntos del paro, debo reconocer que estos en particular si los veo como logros...solo espero que en serio la solucion que salga de todo esta sea lo mejor para el pais"
1762,"Tienes razon que se han logrado cosas compañero, pero el problema ahora sera ver que si se cumplan algunas de esas cosas que se han logrado o que el apoyo (o union nacional) se mantenga. Por poner un ejemplo de cosas que se dijeron para calmar los animos pero al final no se estan cumpliendo: la matricula cero para este 2021 al final se ha hundido en el congreso, asi que la promesa hecha por el gobierno con la cual tanto se ha dicho ""estamos escuchando al pueblo y ayudandolos en este tiempo de necesidad "" al final ha sido algo que han tumbado los mismos que son mas afines al gobierno en el congreso y con ello se ha demostrado que poca cosa se puede confiar en lo ganado (al menos frente a lo que ha "" cedido"" el gobierno central)."
1763,"Gracias en por tus palabras.

En mis 3 décadas de existencia realmente no me habían sentido tan lleno de desesperanza, frustración y decepción. No veo un futuro en este pais. He sido privilegiado, soy profesional de una de las universidades de mayor prestigio del país y desde que me gradué hace 10 años he tenido trabajo. Si yo me siento así, no me imagino el nivel de frustración y desesperanza de los jóvenes menos privilegiados.

Me quedo con lo que dices, nuestra situación es compleja y tomará tiempo mucho tiempo en llegar soluciones de fondo. Nuestra lucha consistirá entonces en asegurar que estemos en la senda correcta hacia el cambio"
1764,De acuerdo.
1765,Sobretodo le devolvieron la popularidad a Uribe jajajaja. Si algo le hizo el paro al CD y a Uribe es mostrar lo desconectados que están con el pueblo y con lo que quieren. No digo que fortaleció a la izquierda. Pero no crea que la reforma tributaria que el CD casi le mete al país le encantó a todo el mundo.
1766,based
1767,"No estoy de acuerdo contigo. El pobre no es pobre porque quiere. Mucha gente se esfuerza, estudia y trabaja de forma honrada. Pero a pesar de su esfuerzo nunca sale de pobre. La movilidad social del país es inexistente, se requieren 11 generaciones para salir de pobre. 

https://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias-45022393

Hay frustración porque a pesar del esfuerzo no hay avances y la clase política y la élite que ha gobernado el país no hace nada."
1768,"Imagínate la gente como yo... que a pesar de ser profesional graduada hace 10 años de Univalle no pude tener un empleo estable porque en mi profesión todo depende de la rosca. Como decidí que no iba a sembrar corrupción, he tenido que trabajar en lo que me saliera; desde logística en una pista de patinaje en un centro comercial hasta empleada doméstica de un extranjero (que es mi trabajo actual). Mi tiempo libre lo invierto en fortalecer mi emprendimiento y hago lo posible por hacerlo crecer. Aún así no voy a huir de mi país. Voy a seguir luchando para aportarle al cambio. Para que las generaciones venideras de científicos puedan tener empleos y verdaderas oportunidades laborales.  Voy a apostarle a sembrar un mejor país. No importa que no lo vea manifestado en lo que me queda de vida, vivo con la certeza de que nada es permanente."
1769,"A nadie le gustó, ese es mi punto.
Si hubiesen dejado de joder Justo después de que presidencia desistiera con la reforma ya nadie lo querría."
1770,"Una persona pobre,no estudia ya que el salirio de su familia es bajo y no alcanzaría a costearse los estudios universitarios,creo que a lo que te refieres de movilidad es a la clase media baja,la cual si estudia sea a base de préstamo, y sigue siendo clase baja, pero el mundo cambio y ahora no es necesario ir a la universidad para progresar puedes aprender a programar y certificarte gratis y trabajar muy bien,lo digo por experiencia,pero para eso hay que cambiar el paradigma mental,revelarse contra ese pensamiento de víctima,y tener fortaleza cognitiva,ahora más que nunca se necesitan personas que sepan de tecnología,éxitos y ojalá sepas que se puede todo es cuestión de misent y ahora con todo esto de la pandemia,cambiar de rubro."
1771,"Si parce, pero que a mucha gente no le haya parecido las formas del paro no significa que eso le dio popularidad a Uribe. Los que veo que se pueden beneficiar bastante si son Enrique Peñalosa, Fico y Char. No apoyaron el paro nunca pero tampoco apoyaron la reforma. Una gran sección de la población se va a sentir identificada con eso."
1772,"Te recomiendo este libro:

[https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Michael-J-Sandel-ebook/dp/B08BX9QJFX/ref=sr\_1\_3?\_\_mk\_es\_US=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=1YE800697NW8G&dchild=1&keywords=la+tirania+de+la+meritocracia&qid=1623804894&sprefix=la+tirania+de+la+meri%2Caps%2C224&sr=8-3](https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Michael-J-Sandel-ebook/dp/B08BX9QJFX/ref=sr_1_3?__mk_es_US=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=1YE800697NW8G&dchild=1&keywords=la+tirania+de+la+meritocracia&qid=1623804894&sprefix=la+tirania+de+la+meri%2Caps%2C224&sr=8-3)

Me parece super interesante porque critica el modelo de universidades y el credidencialismo que se ha creado alrededor del tema. Te aportaria perspectivas interesantes. La idea central del libro es que la meritocracia moderna crea ganadores arrogantes que creen que su posicion privilegiada es producto de su esfuerzo y perdedores humillados que creen que no sea han esforzado lo suficiente. Esta forma de pensar crea muchos problemas que son explicados en el libro. Por ejemplo hace que los ganadores sean menos solidarios o que el estado se meta en la vida de los perdedores para ver si se han esforzado lo suficiente y por lo tanto merecen un subsidio. En verdad es un muy buen libro. Te lo recomiendo, te dará nuevas perspectivas en que pensar.

Creo que estas juzgando las cosas mucho desde tu posicion y experiencia. Que bueno que hayas conseguido trabajo como programador. Efectivamente es una area que no requiere titulos, unicamente habilidades practicas. Pero no todos pueden ser programadores. Para ser programadores se requieren ciertas habilidades que no todo el mundo tiene por mas que estudien. Ademas, tampoco a todo el mundo le gusta. Que tu disfrutes pasar 6, 8 u 12 horas diarias frente a un PC no quiere decir que todo el mundo lo disfrute. Que pasará con las personas que no les gusta? Basado en tu experiencia, no puedes concluir simplemente que  solo es cuestion de esforzarse o cambiar el mindset. Es problema es mas complejo todavia, no lo simplifiques tanto!

Aqui un video que tambien podria aportarte otros puntos de vista

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ML6ABJqBU\_g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ML6ABJqBU_g)

El estudio que te envie sobre movilidad social en el pais con parametros objetivos de la economia nos permite concluir que realmente no existen las condiciones para que la gente salga de pobre o no retrocedan si lo llegan a hacer. Fijate que la conclusion de estos economistas no es que la gente no quiere salir de la pobreza."
1773,"Agree... aunque se me hace que despues de la tumbada de la reforma la de la salud habria sido mejor. Habrian quedado como *salvadores* y el pais se habria ido contra Duque por haber creado tal problema  lol. Esto al irse tan largo y tener tanta desorganizacion lo que ha hecho es que muchos colombianos se esten moviendo a la derecha o los grupos Paramilitares esten creciendo de nuevo. No controlar a muchos de los que hacen vandalismo le ha pasado su factura a los del paro tambien. Yo tengo un vecino que era full-petro  y apoyaba resto las marchas pero una vez vio que no le estaba llegando el surtido a su almacen ahora anda pensando en votar por otra opcion.   


Solo mi opinion.   


Yo solo espero que esto realmente sirva para llevar a Colombia a un mejor lugar. Todo pasa por una razon. Creo que estas marchas han permitido darse cuenta sobre muchas cosas en el pais."
1774,"Si el paro se hubiese desmovilizado en el momento en que se bajo la reforma, la reforma la volverian a subir meses despues, y ni el paro ni el cansancio sirvio de nada. Hay que ser un poco mas ambicioso."
1775,"Siempre me ha parecido que el pueblo colombiano no sabe de protesta, es más bien una sociedad acostumbrada a agachar la cabeza. A estas alturas ya no se va a conseguir nada, el gobierno no va a negociar, porque el paro y los bloqueos en si mismos le convienen, juega con el cansancio de la gente para sacar ventaja política, hace las veces de salvador de una situación que no le interesa arreglar. Las marchas y las protestas son un procedimiento que supone un costo y una inversión muy alta para lograr algo, no solo en Colombia, sino en cualquier parte del mundo, en cualquier lugar del mundo se presentan desmanes y se salen de curso ( estoy seguro que a ninguno nos gustan esas cosas) pero en algunas ocasiones sin algo de eso la sociedad no logra moverse, no pretendo hacer una justificación del vandalismo, pero aquí, antes de conseguir algo la sociedad ya quiere volver a normalidad porque se canso, por eso es una sociedad acostumbrada a agachar la cabeza.

En cuanto a los infiltrados en las protestas, ni  siquiera se puede descartar que que exista de los dos bandos, desde los extremistas que dañar y destrozar es el único camino para reclamar, hasta los que usan los mismos destrozos  para desacreditar la protesta social misma, pues en ese caso particular siempre es más fácil culpar al que sale a protestar.

En fin, no hará falta desde el que no quiera la protesta aunque tenga necesidades y motivos pero prefiero callarse y aguantarse, hasta el que no la quiere, simplemente porque ni leva ni le viene y como están las cosas le parece más conveniente para sus intereses, algo así como si no me afecta, no es mi problema."
1776,"Mi opinion: aunque la reforma como tal fue el detonante del estallido social no se puede tomar en cuenta como la única causa, los sectores vulnerables que son casi un 50% del país (hogares donde los hijos no pueden estudiar y deben elegir entre salir a vender dulces para apoyar a su familia o morir de hambre) actualmente no tienen nada que perder, ni vivienda digna, ni educación, ni salud, ni alimento, por eso eso se llegó a un punto donde no les importa morir, al final, con el abandono que han sufrido, con tantas noches yéndose a dormir acostado a los hijos con hambre, pues la muerte es el único gesto lindo que la vida tendría con ellos, por eso, no estoy a favor de que se levante la movilización hasta que estos grupos lo decidan, porque la movilización es de ellos, los que comemos 3 veces al día no deberíamos ni siquiera discutirlo


Hay otro problema y es que el gobierno no está interesado en hablar con esta población, por ese mismo motivo no se llega a ningún acuerdo con el comité de paro aunque este haya sido prácticamente armado por el gobierno, porque no les interesa, quieren que los pobres sigan bloqueando porque solo van a afectar a otros pobres, y final, los pobres de derecha en su burbuja de privilegios que no son tan privilegios pensarán que el verdadero enemigo son los pobres anti derecha que actualmente se mueren de hambre

En resumen, estamos ante otro triste episodio de la historia colombiana"
1777,"Conozco a una persona relativamente cercana y que es algo conocedora del ambiente político en su interior, así como de los movimientos electorales, él expuso una teoría que se ajusta a lo que usted señala, dijo "" cuando la protesta se radicaliza, lo que ocurre es que la gente se derechiza"", creo que es a eso a lo que le apuesta el gobierno al no negociar, le apuesta a que la gente se canse, se agote de las protestas, al punto de que les afecte, para aparecer no como un gobierno injusto y retrógrado, sino como el salvador del caos y sobre todo del mal que deja la protesta.

Ojalá todo esto sirva sobre todo al momento de ir a las urnas para hacer una elección más madura y consciente, que le pase factura al sistema actual escogiendo mejores gobernantes, y no hablo ni siquiera de votar por Petro, sino de hacerlo de manera más coherente, independientemente de la opción que se escoja."
1778,"Si, pero lastimosamente y con riesgo a que me downvoteeen a lo loco....la reforma de una u otra manera es necesaria. La pandemia dejo un hueco fiscal muy grande y se necesita de alguna estrategia para recuperar la economia del pais. No digo con eso que antes de la pandemia las cosas estuviesen bien o que haya que gravar los alimentos de la canasta basica como lo intento hacer Duque...pero si toca de alguna manera hacer algo al respecto. Todas las grandes crisis no solo.en Colombia sino en la historia del mundo han usado planes similares ""Plan Marshall"" ""el New Deal"" y otros q seguro no recuerdo. En este caso tumbar la reforma tributaria no me parece q haya sido el gran logro del paro como muchos lo quieren poner, sino que lo que hizo fue retrasar algo q es inevitable, espero que alguna nueva estrategia surja de todo este lioy que asi todo lo q se ha sufrido estos ultimos meses haya valido verdaderamente la pena."
1779,Exacto bro. Eso es lo que el quiere. Ellos son maquiavelicos jajajajaa.  Sera esperar en que manos caemos. Yo votare por alguien que me parezca estable y no sea de los mismos. Sera esperar los candidatos que habran. Solo espero que Colombia esta decada vaya en mejor camino y tenga un tipo de renacimiento. Vale soñar.
1780,"> dijo "" cuando la protesta se radicaliza, lo que ocurre es que la gente se derechiza"", creo que es a eso a lo que le apuesta el gobierno al no negociar, le apuesta a que la gente se canse, se agote de las protestas, al punto de que les afecte, para aparecer no como un gobierno injusto y retrógrado, sino como el salvador del caos y sobre todo del mal que deja la protesta.

Tal vez por eso el paro no está consiguiendo nada significativo."
1781,podrian comenzar por reformar la reforma del 2019...
1782,"La reforma habría funcionado, pero hay que recordar que vivimos en Colombia ¿Cuánta plata no se hubiesen robado? XD"
1783,"Yo concuerdo con que la reforma es inevitable. Sin embargo, la reforma se concentra en pedir impuesto a las personas con pocos recuerdos o recursos de estrato medio. Hay muchos mas lugares de donde obtener dinero."
1784,"Si es verdad, ciertamente la corrupcion empeora este escenario.....tal vez esta reforma con el gobierno de turno ya no fue."
1785,"Una opinión impopular pero muy buena parcero!! 

La gente tiene que empezar a cambiar desde el interior, todos esperan que alguien les regale sobretodo en latinoamerica. Mis primos desde Colombia se la pasan diciéndome que les ayude a salir del país y me piden y me piden plata pero nunca quieren dar algo a cambio. Una vez le ayudamos a uno a venir a estudiar (Le pagamos todo) y al final no le gusto por que era muy difícil y se devolvió a hacer nada. Estoy a favor de la protesta y sé que el gobierno tiene la culpa de muchas cosas pero sé que la mayoría de la gente que conozco en Colombia no se quieren esforzar lo suficiente y no quieren cambiar para bien. Ahorita mi primo esta protestando por supuesta falta de oportunidades. 

La izquierda y la derecha es pura manipulación. En mi familia si digo algo bueno de petro ya me tildan de guerrillero y de vago, pero si voy a mi grupo de amigos y digo algo bueno del gobierno de Uribe me tratan mal y me tratan de estupido o de asesino. Todos se la pasan mirando posts o noticias de un solo lado sin mirar el otro y comparar y no aceptan un pensamiento diferente. Los del centro somos más pero nos tratan de obligar a escoger. Si matan a un manifestante, que mataron al vago. Si matan a un policía, que es que se lo merece. La polarización es lo que tiene al país jodido, la gente no se dan cuenta que somos de lo mismo, el gobierno lo sabe entonces usa la estrategia de separar al rival y manipular ambos bandos para que peleen. Por eso llevamos en lo mismo desde la independencia. Mi abuelita me decía que en la época de la violencia la gente no votaba por la persona que era la mejor para el cargo sino por la persona que dijera el partido liberal o conservados. El gobierno nos quiere separados y la gente no se quiere unir. Por eso yo también pienso que Colombia es un pueblo mediocre. El país va a seguir así hasta que se vuelva todo una guerra civil que puede durar otros 100 años y probablemente lo mejor divida el país entre izquierda y derecha. Lastimosamente como muchos me tuve que ir."
1786,"Comparto mucho tu opinión, algo que también quiero destacar es la buena variedad de opiniones en este subreddit, poniéndolo en contraste con otras redes sociales, acá no se es tan víctima de la burbuja  de opinión en la que te envuelven las demás, acá he leído todo tipo de opiniones que aunque no las comparto todas, permiten forjar un pensamiento más sólido y dejar de lado la polarización"
1787,"Toda la razon, tampoco entiendo porque joden tanto con que quieren que tal celebridad diga algo, acaso importa? Con la bandera al reves se demostro que se puede hacer llegar el mensaje a otros lados del planeta, ej lo de Luisito y otras celebridades gringas que dieron su apoyo"
1788,"Diste un paso a la Iluminación. Prepárate para que te tilden de Tibio, Facho o Mamerto según con quién hables.

Y no te preocupes... Así es en todos lados, incluso en los países de dónde quieren copiar lo que sea."
1789,"parce si! estoy 100% de acuerdo. eso se lo debemos a la mala educación del país. la gran mayoría jamas pasa de bachillerato, y por lo que he visto, muchos de ellos no tiene siquiera buen nivel de compression de lectura. Con tan bajo nivel, la mayoría solo cree lo que escucha y simplemente se deja llevar. Para los que quieren educación superior, tienen dos opciones: O son medianamente tesos, o tienen plata. yo trabaje en Admisiones de la UDEA, y cada carrera abre unos 100 a 200 cupos por semestre. Solo pasa como el 5% de los que se presentan. y de ese 5% mas del 30% no llegan a segundo semestre. En resumen: La falta de oportunidades, bajo nivel de educación, y una obsesión de obtener todo de forma fácil heredada de la era del narcotrafico. nos ha convertido en un país de importaculistas que solo se interesan por saber que dicen los famosos y ricos porque ellos quieren llegar a ser famosos y ricos pero sin esfuerzo, y como no tienen educación, no se identifican con los académicos y lo que dicen ellos son bobadas, así que mas fácil le creen a una cadena de Whatsapp con palabras como HUBIERON, HAIGAN y demás horrores ortográficos, porque es mas fácil creer en conspiraciones que en hechos. y es mas fácil echarle la culpa a la guerrilla que a los verdaderos culpables. NOSOTROS!"
1790,"Hmm te daria un premio si tuviera. Yo la verdad estoy cansado con el odio que destilan ambos bandos. Todas las muertes son terribles y no es para alegrarse. Ademas como lo mencionabas Muchos de los Actores-Musicos y deportistas saben solo de su campo. No todos son expertos en Politica para decir las cosas adecuadas en especial con lo confusa que esta la situacion. Ademas poner algo politico los pondria en riesgo al ser figuras publicas facilmente reconocibles.

Shakira recientemente puso algo apoyando a los del paro y que pararan las matanzas. Como la recibieron en los comments???? Le dijeron que era muy tarde que ya no servia de nada su comment. Que mejor se callara y que ella no era Colombiana cuando lleva decadas apoyando al pais mas que muchos. Tambien los Uribistas la atacaron horrible. Si no hablan mal. Si hablan mal. Que pereza. Recientemente atacaron a Juanes cuando el tampoco estaba de acuerdo con las matanzas.

1794,"Personalmente detesto hablar de política con amigos y familiares, ni yo se que tengo definido como bueno o malo pero si algo tengo que decir es que si en internet las cámaras de eco ya son un problema bastante fuerte en los medios tradicionales es aun peor, uno que ya tiene un caminado acá maso menos tiene una idea general de como no caer en estas o al menos no ser tan pendejo manteniéndose a raya frente a estas. Aunque sinceramente celebrar la muerte de cualquiera es un estupidez tremenda, siento que una parte bastante grande del país aun tiene como única fuente de información los medios tradicionales que tristemente desde que empezó todo esto han ninguneado de una forma bastante fea las muertes de civiles que ni uno ni ellos saben con certeza que mierda paso y han glorificado a los heridos de la policía que dicho sea de paso son solo minions que andan comiéndose la mierda de las cagadas que hacen sus superiores por que si de internet aprendí algo es que por unos pocos pagan todos sin importar el bando en el que estés, siempre hacen mas ruido y se le pone mas atención a los que tienen malas intenciones. Tenia ganas de escribir algo al respecto ya que nunca lo hice públicamente, solo queda decir, que la chupen todos los políticos latinoamericanos."

Me parece que esta frase es lo único que se necesita para representar la idiosincrasia del país."
1796,"Parcero, de acuerdo con usted en casi todo

Solo un pequeño punto en el que no estoy de acuerdo, y expongo mi argumento:

Colombia dejará de ser un pueblo mediocre cuándo reciba una mejor formación en la casa que haga que la gente se pueda valer por si misma y no depender de papá Estado, una dónde se prime el trabajo honesto y no la rosca o el fraude para enriquecerse o donde se elimine de la educación en casa la famosa (por desgracia) ""malicia indígena"". Ese es el fin de mi argumento con respecto a ese pequeño punto 

Para los que critican al fútbol, Yo las he pasado verdes cuando niño, y mi mamá sin apoyo del Estado me sacó adelante, aprendí el valor del trabajo y de valerme por mí mismo sin robarle a nadie lo que bien se ha ganado. El fútbol nos distraía de los problemas por 90 minutos cada día cuándo Colombia jugó el mundial del 98, es algo terapéutico  y que ayuda a despejar la mente y disfrutar unos momentos de distracción.

1798,"Lo único raro de ayer es que entro publico después de que el gobierno perdiera aplazar la copa por culpa del covid y así pudiera asistir el público.

Ahora eso de pedirle a los famosos su opiniones en política est mandado a recoger, ellos nunca ganan al decir de que lado están y nuncan son la clave de solucionar el problema. 

Solo mira lo que le pasó a Falcao por algo que puso hace rato en su Twitter o con el caso de Amparo con Margarita."
1799,"Mira que llego a estar de acuerdo con muchas de las cosas que dices, especialmente con lo de no alegrarse por la muerte de policías (o más bien de seres humanos), pero me parece que estás hablando de una forma como si tú no estuvieras criticándolos a ellos de la misma forma que asumes que te criticarían, te dicen tibio y tú a ellos extremistas. El centrismo también es una posición política que puede llevarse al extremo, y lamentablemente si una cosa es cierta es que el país necesita algún cambio grande, lo complicado es saber desde dónde. Nos guste o no, la farándula moviliza a las personas, y eso es algo que también ocurre en otros países más ""avanzados"". Muchos aquí a duras penas alcanzan a subsistir y menos tiempo tienen para detenerse a estudiar el país a fondo. Puede que eso sí les haga ""mediocres"" pero ése no me parece que sea un comentario que ayude a solucionar los problemas de fondo que llevan a eso, sólo polariza de la misma forma que tú estás criticando, es como decir que este país está lleno de mamertos que no quieren trabajar o de paracos. Lo que sí queda claro es que estamos en un momento en el que la gente está desesperada y no sabe que más hacer. Es necesario tomar acción, pero eso lleva al riesgo del extremismo; sin embargo, no tomarla lleva al riesgo de que no se resuelva nada y el paro al final sólo deje al país más desgastado."

1801,"Mira que tienes razón en algunas cosas pero, no se trata de aprobación de parte de alguien famoso, se trata de visibilización y empatía, a mi no me interesa lo que opine james o silvestre dangond, me interesa lo que pueden lograr con sus actos y palabras, no le tires la pelota a la gente por querer apoyo, tírale la bola a los que no apoyan por ser tan mediocres y diferentes para no creerse parte de Colombia, otra cosa es que no se ha obligado a nadie ellos mismos se muestran en silencio y no por solo tener un cartón de graduados en el colegio significa que no tengan un pensamiento más allá de seguir una pelota, hay que tener cuidado con las palabras porque si de mediocridad hablamos ser elitista es un prejuicio muy rebuscado para dar una opinión, conozco mucha gente sin estudios que tienen una postura muy clara con la situación del país, tu último comentario de derecha e izquierda, claro que si y por lo mismo y tanto no se trata de si eres médico académico o futbolista, es una razón humanitaria."
1802,"Eh sabes cuánto gana un futbolista como falcao? Es absurdo que no invierta su dinero, al menos una parte en ayudar a otros en Colombia. Eso es lo que molesta, todo estos futbolista millonarios que prefieren comprarse un Lamborghini envés de darle un techo a los más pobres. Creo que tú opinion es válida hasta cierto punto, pero no es cierto que el fútbol no sea una cortina de humo porque si lo es y además lo han usado para lavar dinero, entonces como qué es momento de reevaluar si necesitamos fútbol en este momento. Saludos."

Ahorita mi primo esta protestando por supuesta falta de oportunidades.

1815,"Yo tampoco creo que la opinión de un futbolista tenga valor en una situación como ésta. Pero lo que se busca es que al alcance de estas personas artistas o deportistas, sea utilizado para promover un mensaje positivo para el pais en general y las personas afectadas por lo que está pasando. No sabemos la posición política de nuestros deportistas y artistas y lo mas seguro es que no nos guste lo que piensen y ellos saben y por eso no dicen nada. Aun asi tienen una comunidad que los siguen y apoyan, por ende un mensaje de solidaridad independientemente de su posición, seria de gran ayuda para muchos."

Tienes totalmente la razón. Mira el caso de Amparo Grisales: en Twitter hacían puras bromas de ''¿Qué país le vamos a dejar a nuestros hijos y a Amparo Grisales?'' hasta que ella misma salió a criticar Margarita Rosa de Francisco y al Paro en general. 

Queremos las opiniones de los demás pero nos indignamos cuando no son las nuestras."
1820,"u/kubick123 No quiero generalizar y solo estoy hablando desde mi experiencia. De las 150 personas que conozco bien en Colombia, 100 son jóvenes. Me crie en estrato 2 pero gracias al trabajo de mis papas pasamos a 3, así que la mayoría de la gente que conozco es estrato 3 pero conozco de estrato 2 y de 5. De esos jóvenes el 40% fue o esta en la universidad. Como un 60% de los que están en la universidad solo quieren salir rápido para parchar con los amigos. Muchos de los que estudian IT me dicen que les haga la tarea y no es por que sea difícil si no por que quieren hacer otras cosas o no entendieron el tema(y no se animan a preguntar o a buscar) y después o se echan la materia o al final del semestre le ruegan al profesor que les deje un trabajo para pasar raspando. 

El otro 40% es gente seria que estudia y trabaja. De los serios hay un 60% de probabilidad que encuentre trabajo depende de el esfuerzo que hizo. 

Los que no fueron a estudiar la gran mayoría se fue a buscar trabajo de albañil y a vivir del día a día, los otros viven con los papas sin hacer nada diciendo que no se mueven por falta de oportunidades.

Hay muchas oportunidades que no son fáciles de conocer por ejemplo en mi campo de IT muchas empresas de USA o aquí en Japón donde buscan gente de Latinoamérica o India(demasiada gente es contratada así) para que trabajen remotamente. Hay competencias de programación donde no es necesario ganar, pero con demostrar buena habilidad las grandes compañías de tech lo buscan para qué les trabaje. Saber ingles da mucha ventaja y es lo que más le recomiendo a la gente, por qué no saben la información que se pierden. Conozco una muchacha que se graduó de música pero sabiendo ingles le dieron trabajo en un call center en ingles y le pagan mucho más del mínimo. En mi caso me metí a un culto en donde ellos me pagaron la educación en Estados Unidos y nunca en mi vida pensé que eso era posible.

Es cierto que Colombia esta muy mal y la desigualdad es terrible pero el que sabe lo que quiere puede conseguirse una buena oportunidad que le cambie la vida."
1821,"Alguna vez has escuchado de la UNAD? SENA? SOFIAPLUS.

1822,"Nah parcero, no es sensato solo basarse en cosas generalmente extrinsecas a la politica o ideologias como lo son la corrupcion, violencia, ira, etc para decir ""los dos lados son iguales!"", algo que el tibio promedio hace siempre

JAMAS los dos lados seran iguales, debido a la moral, valores y el monton de corrientes que existen dentro de estas mismas difiriendo en temas politicos, economicos y sociales, y es importante saber esto para ser mas objetivo a la hora de criticar

Ah, y no, tampoco es que yo quiera que todos se hagan matar por su partido y que anden siempre peleandose, obviamente seria mejor si la cultura colombiana, e incluso en otros paises, fuese menos violenta y conflictiva en estos temas y en otros miles mas"
1823,"No sabía que ser sensato era reducir una historia de conflicto ideológicos y políticos a un discurso como ""ambos lados son malos"". Eso no ayuda en nada. Ambos lados NO son iguales y nunca lo serán, sin importar que usted pueda hacer una crítica de los dos y trate de equipararlos y esto se hace mucho más evidente en Colombia gracias al conflicto."
1824,"Pero es que decir, que el pueblo colombiano es mediocre, es una generalización estupida, hay gente que nació en una extrema pobreza, trabajan todo el dia y por mantener a su familia y demás, no tuvieron tiempo de estudiar nunca.
Por que cada situación de cada colombiano es diferente por ejemplo.

El pueblo colombiano para mi, es analfabeta o ignorante, pero no mediocre, yo crecí en un ambiente de gente campesina, que gente para trabajar y para hacer cosas increible, esa gente no solo que nunca ponen un pero para hacer las cosas, si no que las hacen, si esa gente no tuviesen la necesidad inmediata de trabajar para suplir sus necesidades y la de sus seres cercanos, creame que todos serian estudiosos.
Pero lastimosamente, cada colombiano es una historia unica.

La vida es dura, tanto, que por más que usted trabaje y se esfuerce, puede que nunca logre algo por las circunstancias mismas de la vida.

Con respecto al punto de la India, hay mucha gente de allá que logra, un buen empleo tanto por trabajo más las circunstancias del empleo, su vida en ese momento.
Como otros que los tienen literalmente amarrados en trabajos de mierda, por las H1B.


Pero por eso le digo, es su situación y su percepción de la misma con los demás.

Durante las prácticas busque aprender todo lo posible de mis superiores, y eso hizo que me contrataran a tiempo completo y me facilitaran entrar a la Universidad. Fuera de eso he hecho cursos y certificaciones gratuitas. Opciones hay en educación."
1831,"Respecto a lo de elegir comer, el motivo por el que entré al SENA fue porque en mi familia ninguno tenía trabajo, así que las prácticas me venían de maravilla, eran 6 meses de trabajo asegurado y la posibilidad de que me contrataran después para algo, ya que sin experiencia en nada, no estaba obteniendo trabajo en nada.

Eso sí, no fue nada fácil, solía dormir solo 4 o 5 horas diarias para hacer los trabajos, y luego cuando estaba en prácticas hubo semanas en que llegaba a casa a las 2am para estar en el trabajo a las 8am. Pero ha valido la pena."

1837,"Pido disculpas por adelantado, texto largo a continuación.

**Problemática:**

Quiero iniciar con lo siguiente del lado de la educación: Si considero que en algunas instituciones lo que se aprende no es mucho, y hay temas que considero nos son faltantes, ya que muchas situaciones se podrían resolver de forma distinta si todos contásemos con ciertos conocimientos desde la adolescencia.

Aún así, la posición que hay respecto a que es la educación pública la que siempre enseña muy poco la veo errónea, la educación privada necesita ofrecer algo para que las personas estén dispuestas a pagarla, y tal vez que pongamos estos conocimientos como lo mínimo para un trabajo es lo que está mal. Hay algo que me enseñaron hace muchos años, ya no recuerdo exactamente quien y era lo siguiente:

Cada categoría de la educación tiene un propósito, las carreras técnicas están para enseñar lo necesario para la ejecución de una tarea o profesión, siendo más o menso un 80/20 entre conocimientos prácticos y conocimientos teóricos. Las carreras tecnológicas están para enseñarte en partes iguales teoría y practica, de forma que sabes como se ejecuta una tarea y tienes las bases para tomar las decisiones requeridas en el momento cuando se presentan situaciones no contemplables en la planeación. Las carreras profesionales buscan enseñar la mayor cantidad de conocimientos teóricos para realizar el análisis y planeación previos necesarios para la ejecución de un proyecto a mayor escala. En resumen era algo así:

|Tipo de carrera|Conocimientos prácticos (%)|Conocimientos teóricos (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Técnico|80|20|
|Tecnólogo|50|50|
|Profesional|20|80|

**Mi contexto personal:**

Ahora, para seguir mi propia propuesta, mi contexto.  
Mi educación inicial fue privada, y en un colegio que me permitió adquirir unos conocimientos de varias materias como política y economía, ya que eran una materia de 10mo y 11vo grado. Eso si, no era un colegio de elite o algo así, el costo de la mensualidad era de unos 150.000 pesos hace 7 años.

Luego de esto fue la educación pública en el SENA, mi carrera es programación de software (por si a alguien le interesa, espero que no). Para continuar hacia carrera profesional en universidad privada (esto como sugerencia de uno de mis jefes, un hombre que respeto mucho).

**Mi propuesta:**

Hay que hacer cambios en la educación, eso es cierto, pero también hay que pensar en qué conocimientos nos hacen falta, ya que a veces pedimos cosas que de mejor o peor manera ya existen en nuestro país, solo que a veces las ignoramos. 

Pero también hay que reevaluar nuestro concepto del mínimo requerido, ya que si solicitamos conocimientos avanzados para tareas de ejecución, o para cargos que no requieren dichos conocimientos, estamos propiciando un circulo vicioso en el cual cada vez es más un despropósito el tener un sistema educativo escalonado (en teoría primero se es técnico, luego tecnólogo y por último profesional según como se de la vida profesional).

En conclusión, la educación si debe cambiar, pero también nuestra visual de que es lo necesario en la educación y para que tareas esto debería bastar, no tener los tipos de títulos como un adorno, cada uno tiene una implicación, respetémosla."
1838,"Bueno, antes de hablar de revoluciones, habría que conocer todo el panorama, así como las herramientas que ya hayan para hacer cambios, o los cambios que solo necesitan ejecutarse y no implementarse.

Lo que usted comenta de los aviones, debo leerlo, ya que no conozco los detalles. Pero si usted tiene alguna idea de en qué sector habría hecho falta esa inversión, me gustaría leerla."
1839,"La verdad veo la opción de evaluar o cambiar educación como algo viable, también se necesita mayor cobertura, todavía hay un 20% que no tiene acceso.

Lo que tú dices de conocimientos avanzados simplemente no es viable en un mundo globalizado, si hay mano de obra mas barata e igual o me costosa los industriales simplemente no van a venir, hay que ser competitivo. 

Lo que se puede es hacer un sistema por escalafones, muy estandarizado, algo similar a nuestro sistema de colegio, pero reduciría la calidad general de la educación al limitar mucho los temas que se pueder tocar y como se pode hacer. Y tendría otra ventaja, no más eternos en la u."
1840,"Socio, usted la tiene clara no ha pensado en compartir este pensamiento o propuesta en algun otro lugar Aparte de Reddit? Colombianos en Reddit somos pocos, un grupo en algun otro lugar puede ayudar"
1841,"Perdón nuevamente, texto largo a continuación.

Disculpa u/sapajul, no se si entiendo correctamente tu idea, lo que entiendo es esto:

**Sobre el sistema de educación:**

Entiendo que se buscaría hacer obligatoria esta escalada entre los títulos profesionales, de alguna manera, como podría ser por normativa, aunque creo que en este sentido es mejor no involucrar a las leyes, sino que sea algo más de nosotros como comunidad. (Si me disculpas, tengo muchos inconvenientes personales con la idea de que todo sea manejado por leyes o autoridades, siento que quita la capacidad de auto-control a la larga)

Respecto a lo de hacer un sistema de escalones, sobre el papel, esto es lo que son los títulos de técnico, tecnólogo y profesional, en teoría uno debería iniciar preferiblemente como técnico para obtener empleo con mayor facilidad. Luego, con tiempo y experiencia, buscar pasar al grado de tecnólogo, adquiriendo los conocimientos más teóricos. Así finalmente está el grado de profesional, el cual se buscaría cuando la persona desee aspirar a las posiciones más altas y de responsabilidad y planeación.

Con esto los cargos deberían tener una correspondencia más o menos así:

&#x200B;

|Título|Tipo de cargos que lo requieren|
|:-|:-|
|Técnico|Cargos de baja responsabilidad, basados en la ejecución de una tarea ya planificada. (Operarios, técnicos, asesoría, atención inicial al cliente, primera línea)|
|Tecnólogo|Cargos de baja o media responsabilidad que requieran el análisis de la situación para la toma de decisiones inmediatas en sitio. En mi opinión aquí podrían estar: Los primeros lideres de equipos, para equipos pequeños, aquellos encargados de problemas más complejos que un primera línea n pueda solucionar, tal vez todas las versiones ""senior"" de los cargos del nivel anterior.|
|Profesional|Cargos de responsabilidad, encargados de la planeación, administración y gestión de alto nivel. (Gerentes, administradores, lideres de área)|
|Especialización|Cargos de alta responsabilidad pero que a su vez requieran grandes conocimientos de un área específica|

**Acerca de requerimientos de contratación:**

En el caso de lo que expuse, lo de reevaluar que consideramos como requerimiento para un trabajo, lo dije por la siguiente situación:

Algunas ofertas laborales aquí en Colombia solicitan conocimientos o títulos de mucho mayor nivel de lo que la tarea a realizar requiere, y por lo tanto hacen que titulaciones que deberían corresponder a este nivel sean descartadas como no aptas EJ: Solicitar personas con título profesional para labores que se podrían hacer con conocimientos técnicos o tecnológicos.

Esto a su vez hace que todos busquemos dichas titulaciones desde el inicio de la vida laboral, y estas titulaciones obviamente son más costosas tanto en tiempo como en dinero. Así es como tenemos ofertas que buscan profesionales para ser operarios, o atención al cliente o realizar tareas que no requieren de los conocimientos que dicha titulación acarrea.

Esta situación la he visto mucho aquí, hablaré desde mi experiencia. En ocasiones me han llegado ofertas laborales de empresas nacionales, las cuales solicitan conocimientos muy avanzados (conocimientos que tiene uno de mis amigos y primer ""maestro"", el cual tiene más de 8 años de experiencia) para cargos de ""2 años de experiencia"" y con nombres tipo ""junior"" o simple ""programador"" (y el salario que esto implica). 

Por otra lado, he visto ofertas de empresas extranjeras o multinacionales, las cuales por estos mismos conocimientos buscan lideres de equipo o ""programadores senior"" de más de 5 años de experiencia, y por lo tanto el salario es el doble que el que ofrecemos aquí.

Entonces, ¿por qué aquí pedimos tantos conocimientos para un cargo básico y lo pagamos peor que en el extranjero?"
1842,"La verdad, esta es de las primeras veces en mi vida que he decidido compartir mi pensar públicamente.

¿Ustedes tienen alguna sugerencia de formas de tal vez hacer esto?"
1843,"Añado otra historia personal:

En mi primer trabajo, hace cerca de 4 años o así, el equipo de calidad éramos 4 personas, 3 ""tester"" (los que hacíamos como tal las pruebas de calidad) y nuestro líder de equipo. Los tester éramos todos graduados del SENA, e incluso yo era el mayor con 19, con el tiempo un compañero y yo empezamos a desear algo mejor laboralmente, yo quería pasar de calidad de software a desarrollo y este compañero un mejor salario.

Pasado un corto tiempo yo renuncié a la empresa para aceptar una oferta como desarrollador, una experiencia... digna de otro post tal vez. 

Por otro lado este compañero se cambio a una empresa extranjera, y le duplicaron el salario para realizar incluso menos trabajo, ya que en nuestro anterior cargo nosotros debíamos atender múltiples proyectos y trasnochar hasta por semanas seguidas, en su nuevo cargo solo debía ejecutar pruebas ya planificadas e incluso automatizadas (en otras palabras, solo revisar los resultados de una simulación).

Aquí pude terminar de confirmar algo que ya había visto antes, aquí buscamos personal con capacidad en teoría, muy superior a lo requerido y por el mismo salario. No apreciamos ni nuestras profesiones ni nuestros profesionales.

Y nos ha ido llevando poco a poco a tener profesionales mediocres, ya que adaptamos toda nuestra educación y aspiraciones como personas a este ambiente laboral donde el nombre del título ya no representa lo que debería."
1844,"Hay 3 situaciones aquí

En primer lugar tu tienes acceso a una visión limitada de la oferta laboral de cualquier lugar, acá en Colombia he visto los dos casos, ofertas laborales con títulos como director de procurement pidiendo elementos acordes a la oferta como MBA 10 años de experiencia y 15'000,000 y lo opuesto, con nombre propio, PQP pidiendo un Senior Cost Management, con 2 años de experiencia y por 2,000,000 COP. Pero esto es un simple juego de nombres y título, para jugar con la oferta de personal. 

El segundo punto es que el costo de una persona no se limita a cuánto pagas. Por ejemplo si comparas con un salario en USA sin beneficios, tienes que multiplicar el salario Colombiano por 1.57, porque acá hay unos beneficios de ley que son una carga conciderable para el empleador.

Por último es el tema de competitividad nacional, miremos una bolso, tipo Totto, puede hacerse en Colombia, China y hagamos un hipotético USA. Se vende en centro y suramérica, A un precio medio de 40 USD, de esos $40 tiene que salir todos los costos, entonces, china, la mano de obra es barata, el transporte a puerto es casi que grátis, la materia prima es aceptable en precio, en Colombia la mano de obra es muy barata, pero el transporte a puerto es mortal, y los costos de materiales también son altos. En el hipotético USA el transporte y la materia prima son expectaculares, la mano de obra es terrible. Este balance es complejo y varía con cada producto, pero como es un mundo globalizado, hay muchos factores que hacen que la cosa sea mucho más que simplemente decir paguemos más."
1845,"Bueno, respecto a salarios, no considero que una solución sea incrementar su valor, más bien lo considero una problemática tal y como tu la expones, ya que el alto costo de cada empleado para una empresa que causan parafiscales y otros beneficios que aquí poseemos hace casi imposible para una gran empresa la idea de ofrecer sueldos altos, o para pequeñas empresas la idea de crecer hasta ser medianas o grandes.

En mi anterior respuesta no trataba de indicar que el salario sea lo que está mal, sino el perfil profesional buscado, de momento no me involucro con salarios ya que es un tema muy complejo y extenso que depende de muchos factores relativos.

Es verdad lo que comentas de esta tendencia a adquirir únicamente el producto de menor valor, pero no es una regla siempre válida, eso también depende del mercado objetivo, ya que otros factores como calidad, ser producto ""artesanal"", producto ""de lujo"", afectan la demanda. Ahora, si tratamos de competir únicamente con estrategia de dar el menor precio, siempre estaremos en desventaja si queremos a la vez ofrecer beneficios a nuestros trabajadores. Es por esto que en mi opinión, desde el inicio esta descartado el competir en este aspecto, así que es necesario dar un valor agregado a aquello que ofrecemos al mundo."
1846,"Creo que fue Porter el que dijo que las estrategias por precio no son sostenibles, pero el precio siempre debe ser parte de la estrategia. Colombia ha logrado lo que tú mencionas con el café, pero eso requiere siglos de trabajo y un elemento diferenciadores, en la época moderna es difícil y depende de los gremios y empresas para generar la diferencia.

Otros ejemplos en Colombia son el pescado, flores y cacao. Me atrevería a decir que azul ultra mar también.

El problema con esta idea es que como puedes ver es limitada. Y genera competencia interna, y vuelve nuevamente al precio. 

Necesitamos mejorar la competitividad y reducir los costos de flete, la situación es que ésto no se logra con protestas, quejas o violencia. Históricamente solo lo han logrado países con una política estable que favorece la inversión extragera, un ejemplo en Latinoamérica es Chile, aunque ellos lo lograron de forma cuestionable."
1847,"Yo voy primero,

Un pirobo que yo ni conocía y su parche llegaron a mi casa porque un ricachón que me cae como el orto y es el que pone el chorro. Este pirobo era un completo pelmaso, se la pasaba pendiente de facebook, acaparaba la comida y la escondía para dársela a su combo y hasta rompió un pocillo y no avisó que la había cagado.

En fin, este cabrón, incluso después de que sus parceros más cercanos se fueran por las vergüenzas y el ridículo que hacían, nada que se iba. Ahí estaba, haciendo las mismas maricadas pero con gente que llamaba e invitaba a mi casa sin preguntarme.

Pero cómo iba a reportar bien si andaba de paseo el Defensor... No llego a varios PMU y nunca se vio Defensoría en las marchas realmente..."
1882,Pa otro lado con esos paros
1883,"El paro sigue, duelale a quien le duela. Es la democracia maestro"
1884,"Es broma ,verdad?"
1885,Ya habiendo leído el articulo: ¿Los del centro democrático de verdad creen que la CIDH se va a tragar eso?
1886,Más desestabilizado de lo que ya estaba pre paro? No lo se Rick.
1887,"Mandaron a la cabal a la CIDH jajajaja,,😂 ellos mismos se encargan de hundirse"
1888,Duque no necesita yuda para que su gobierno sea inestable... Lo hace bien sólito
1889,🤣🤣🤣🤣 El solito se desestabilizo solo el Porky pig.
1890,"No es broma, él ya se despertó y se va a revelar contra la conspiración homosexualjudeocomunista que nos va a destruir"
1891,Confirmo. A mi me pagan 5 millones diarios por día para retwittear los twits de Petro el Petrista
1892,Así que los comerciales de hacer 5 palos desde casa  no eran mentira
1893,">...una cosa es ser de derecha y otra querer aguantarme injusticias en contexto a algo similar a a esto los futbolistas...


Lo del fútbol era solo para dar contexto? porque más bien parece el tema central de tu publicación."
1894,"Mi perro, te enseñaron puntuación en el liceo?"
1895,Si es el tema central  por que la gente se ofende pir que jueguen y digan que es cortina de huma un partido donde la politoca es agena solo queria iniciar con otra cosa dando entender que apoyo el paro siendo de derecha pero en contra lo cual hizo una reaccion a que alguien un deportista se pronunciara cuando no es su obligacion y que tiene pensar diferente y eso hay que respetarlo y que por ello la gente se ofende y dice disque cortina de humo algo que se olaneo antes del paro.
1896,"Si, pero escribo rapido y la olvido ahi si mi error pido disculpas."
1897,"Las personas nos dejamos manipular fácilmente una vez ganan nuestra confianza y repetimos como loros lo que nos dicen hasta el punto que se hace verdad en nuestra mente, y eso es precisamente lo que está pasando con muchos manifestantes y personas de a pie, escuchan algo de sus referentes; a  quienes ya depositaron su confianza y lo creen sin dudarlo.

Es así también con lo que mencionas, alguien dijo que se deberían suspender todos los partidos y que no deberían jugar porque el país está en protesta, pero ni siquiera cuestionan que ese argumento era probablemente aceptable para no celebrar una Copa América en un país herido, pero que nada aplica para un partido de un torneo diferente que así como mencionas ya venía planificado con anterioridad y que no se celebra en el país.

El hecho de que estemos furiosos con nuestro gobierno no debe ser excusa para querer parar al mundo entero, para que nos vean y se pronuncien, como un niño cuando busca atención.

A ver si descargan esa furia en las elecciones futuras."
1898,A esto me refiero y hay punto del paro qye estan bien pero otros que son ilogicos y los colomvianos del esterior haciendo protesta en un pais ageno donde no pueden hacer nada pir que no hya juridiccion y donde estan es interesados en mejorar es ese pais en cuastio piensan que los otros paises haran algo al respecto cuando es la onu como tal solo por las muertes en manifestaciones las cuales rechazo obviamente por que nunca hay que matar a alguien por que oiense diferente pero creen que haran algo llenando time square las protestas se hacen en el pais no en paises ajenos donde no hay juridiccion y ademas que no hacen nada tan orgullosos que la protesta es en un sitio que nada que ver y los ven es como inmigrantes nada mas es algo ilogico para mi no se que diras vos.
1899,"Son protestas en contra del éxito (eslogan ""el exito huele a muerte"") a proposito de las torturas que ocurrieron en el exito Cali el 19 de mayo, protestas similares suceden en todas las ciudades principales, algunas más artísticas y otras más crudas.

No son el tipo de ""montaje"" que ud. se imagina; la mayoría de los éxito están siendo cubiertos de pintura roja y se toman fotografías de escenas sangrientas para darle visibilidad a ese evento en particular, ya que los medios tradicionales no lo mencionan nunca."
1900,Ya fue desmentido el trino
1901,"Países explorando planetas, inventando nuevos materiales, creando vacunas para virus mortales en tiempo récord y acá todavía toca explicarle a la gente (y en este caso empresarios, todavia peor) que no tenés que ser indigente para apoyar causas sociales. Es que con gente con ese nivel ¿cómo se construye país? Esto no ha colapsado de milagro.   


(Aunque el comité del paro hace mucho que no representa a nadie realmente y no es más que una partida de viejos sindicalistas que están igual de desconectados del país que este remedo de gobierno, pero eso es tema aparte)."
1902,"La mayoría de los jefes sindicales en Colombia son un cáncer igual que los políticos, solo hay que ver el sindicato de taxis y su negativa a la reglamentación de las apps, el sindicato camionero y su oposición al tren, los sindicatos de empresas publicas como EMCALI que tienen gastos excesivos, y así hay un sin fin de ejemplos.

Lo que publico Mario Hernández aunque no sea cierto, no es alejado de la realidad, ya que cada trabajador afiliado al sindicato se le descuenta una parte de su salario, que anda a saber a donde va a parar."
1903,Eat the rich
1904,"Hace aun mayor parte del post, lo que hizo Mario hernandez fue intentar decir que los ricos controlaba ese paro y la gente no debería sentirse identificado con esos representantes"

1906,"> el comité del paro hace mucho que no representa a nadie realmente y no es más que una partida de viejos sindicalistas que están igual de desconectados del país que este remedo de gobierno

Solamente están para hacer proselitismo para la izquierda."
1907,">el sindicato de taxis y su negativa a la reglamentación de las apps

Para eso hay muy buenas razones. Las apps no resuelven ningún problema, y sí aumentan la precariedad de los dueños y conductores de taxi. Además, las apps no quiere reglamentar el sector; quieren desreglamentarlo para poder hacer lo que quieran.

&#x200B;

>Lo que publico Mario Hernández aunque no sea cierto, no es alejado de la realidad

Que una mentira concuerde con nuestra opinión no la acerca a la realidad... No está ni cerca de ser cierto. Además, si así lo fuera, lo único que muestra es el dolor que le da ver a alguien distinto a él y a los suyos ganando plata.

Eso no quiere decir que fecode no sea la cagada. Salir a marchar y a hacer conciertos, pero negarse a retomar funciones es un sinsentido total.

&#x200B;

>el sindicato camionero y si oposición al tren

Esos sí son la cagada. Pero no son sólo los camioneros, son los dueños de los camiones. Esos dos grupos no son lo mismo."
1908,"> La mayoría de los jefes sindicales en Colombia son un cáncer igual que los políticos

A ellos no les importa el país. Solo les importa ellos mismos."
1909,There's only one thing that they are good for
1910,">Las apps no resuelven ningún problema

""La rueda no resuelve ningún problema"".

""La electricidad no resuelve ningún problema"".

""La física cuántica no resuelve ningún problema"".

Así de ridículo suena eso.

En cuanto a que las aplicaciones no quieran reglamentar, pues habrá algunas que sí, otras que no; a medida que pase el tiempo tendrán que ajustarse a las regulaciones laborales de todo el mundo."
1911,"Es claro que las apps no resuelven el problema de transporte, pero si que se necesita una regularización como cualquier otro sector. Justo ahora las apps están haciendo lo que quieran porque no hay regularización, no entiendo como una regularización desreglamentaria el sector de transporte. 

Quieres un ejemplo de como ganan los sindicalista te muestro EMCALI, la mafia sindical que existe es tan grande, que ningún alcalde ha podido con ella, Mauricio Armitage fue uno de los que más batalló y fue el que publicó las cifras y la cantidad de beneficios de un trabajador sindicalizado, llegando a que un aseador este ganando hasta 4 millones y empleados administrativos de nivel 1 lleguen a ganar hasta 15 millones

Si quieres leer el articulo completo de los beneficios ridiculos de los sindicalizados en EMCALI te dejo el link.

[https://incp.org.co/los-insostenibles-salarios-de-emcali/](https://incp.org.co/los-insostenibles-salarios-de-emcali/)

Sindicatos como los de EMCALI hay muchos, y el problema no es que ganen toda esa plata, el problema es que no les importa si la empresa esta en crisis y pierda competitividad como es el caso de EMCALI, solo les importa recibir sus beneficios y listo.

>Esos sí son la cagada. Pero no son sólo los camioneros, son los dueños de los camiones. Esos dos grupos no son lo mismo.

Los dueños de los camiones por lo general son los lideres sindicales de los camioneros, es como en los taxis, son los dueños de los taxis los lideres sindicales."
1912,">no entiendo como una regularización desreglamentaria el sector de transporte.

Por la regulación actual prohíbe explícitamente la modalidad de trasporte propuesta por las apps. Lo que quieren es que se eliminen esas reglas de funcionamiento (tarifa regulada, carros con placa especial, aportes a seguridad social, limites regionales para operación, etc) que no los deja funcionar como ellos quieren"
1913,"No entiendo como eso es malo, al contrario, hasta beneficia a los taxistas quitar tanta regularizaciones y costos absurdos como lo es el ""cupo"""
1914,"El problema es que ellos ya pagaron ese cupo por esa regulación... Haga la cuenta y verá el tamaño del problema. Hoy en día un cupo de taxi en Bogotá puede costar 80 millones. Eso no es un impuesto; es un precio de mercado resultado de las reglas de juego que dice (incomprensiblemente) que en Bogotá no puede haber más de 50k taxis. Ya hay gente que pagó eso por el derecho de tener un taxi legal en Bogotá. Cuando se permita operar sin ese requisito, ese cupo pasa a costar 0; el que ya pagó eso, perdió.

Hay 50k taxis en Bogotá. 50k\*80'000.000 = 4 BILLONES de pesos. 4 billones de pesos que simplemente se DESAPARECEN de un día para otro por quitar esa regulación para que Uber et. al. puedan seguir sacando plata de Colombia. Es un buen ejemplo de la importancia de la estabilidad jurídica."
1915,"El cupo no se paga anual, así que los 4 billones no desaparece de un día para otro, ahora habrá que ver cuales son las cifras de taxis nuevos que entran a circular pero no creo que cada año entren 50k taxis, y con la presentación de algunos taxis, se nota que hay muchos taxis más viejos que matusalen

Otra cosa, el sistema de cupo, ni siquiera es regulado por el estado, ese sistema solo lo usaron los grandes dueños de taxis que son los que venden los ""cupos"" para aprovecharse de una ley absurda y hacer negocio. Que se quite el cupo, solo le quita ese negocio, por eso no les conviene que lo hagan.

Lastima por los que ya lo pagaron, pero el ""cupo"" se debe de quitar junto con muchas otras regulaciones, esto para hacer el sector competitivo."
1916,"Claro, no es algo que se paga anual porque no es una tarifa, licencia, o impuesto del distrito o el estado. Y no se le paga al estado, es algo que ya pagaron todas las personas que tienen un taxi legal en Bogotá.

Pueden vender un carro vuelto mierda en 90 millones siempre y cuando tenga el cupo legal y luego ese cupo se puede pasar a un carro nuevo para seguir trabajando (el viejo se chatarriza o se vuelve carro particular con placa amarilla). Y esos 80 millones no los define el estado ni el distrito; es el precio normal de un taxi legal y la gente lo paga porque sabe que es una inversión rentable.

El día que quiten esa restricción esa gente pierde ese capital; el carro que antes costaba 90 millones ya no cuesta nada. Es capital colombiano, que está en manos de ciudadanos colombianos, se pierde de un día para otro porque ya nadie va a pagar esa plata pudiendo hacer lo mismo con un carro particular. Son 4 billones de pesos que se pierden de un plumazo...

Puede que la ley sea absurda, pero quitarla tiene consecuencias reales sobre personas reales que pierden su capital. No creo correcto que se haga tan abruptamente y menos para darle gusto a empresas con prácticas laborales y de impuestos muy cuestionables pa' que nos sigan ordeñando."
1917,"Una lastima, pero no es culpa de nadie, las inversiones son así, o puedes recuperar tu capital o puedes perderlo, las personas hacen negocio sabiendo eso, no tiene sentido que no se reforme un sector económico solo porque hay personas que perderán dinero. 

Además, estas viendo solo desde el punto de vista del que pierde, tienes que mirar también del que gana, el que iba a comprar un cupo de 80 millones, puede ahora comprarse dos carros y ponerlos a trabajar."
1918,"Según ellos  todos los demás son de Uribe, el único no corrupto es petro.  Petro es muy keynesiano, como es el gobierno actual. Creen que con petro Colombia cogerá el cielo con las manos."
1919,"Porque la polarización cegó a la gente. Para la gente de izquierda o de derecha todo es blanco o negro, no existe el gris. Si usted no es A entonces es B, cuando usted puede ser Q, 8 o #."
1920,La gente está loca y todos tienen el ego tan alto que creen que sus ideas serán as que salven el país.
1921,"Creo que es un fenomeno mental-psicologico del populismo asi como pasa con Trump/Bolsonaro/Chavez. Petro les ha vendido ideas-mentiras y ellos empiezen a sentir que el su amigo y salvador. Petro podria atacarles su propia familia y ellos aun estarian al lado de el dandole honra. Lo mismo le pasa a los Uribistas que tratan a Uribe como un Dios.   


A mi lo que mas me parece gracioso es que Petro es de los politicos que mas dinero tiene en este pais y muchos creen que es del pueblo lmfao. Ese señor vive desconectado de la realidad del Colombiano promedio.  Lo que ese tipo quiere es enriquecerse mas....como la mayoria.  


Yo soy de izquierda economicamente-ideologicamente y vote por petro en las elecciones pasadas pero una vez lo segui en twitter y vi sus entrevistas me di cuenta del riesgo tan enorme que es ese señor. Su lenguaje corporal denota odio y egocentrismo. Es tan malo como los politicos del ramo de Uribe. Tambien la manera en que glorifica a Venezuela-Cuba-Chavez es de miedo. Cuando el agua suena es porque piedras lleva.....  


Yo la verdad siento que hay un monton de personas en la izquierda que tienen la inabilidad de ver las cosas que estan mal en su partido y denunciarlas. Para ellos todo lo que hace la izquierda es bueno porque es la izquierda y si dices algo malo usan la violencia o te llaman ""tibio"" zzzzz. Este tipo de ""niebla mental"" termina convirtiendolos en algo tan malo como la Derecha.  Es como cuando las personas de la izquierda condenan las cosas horribles que hace Estados Unidos pero se niegan a ver las atrocidades que hace China como nacion. La objetividad se ha perdido en los partidos politicos y es lo que nos tiene tan mal.   


Podran atacarme pero yo lo reitero. El siguiente presidente de Colombia no debe ser alguien del centro democratico o petro. Debe ser alguien diferente."
1922,"Porque la gente sigue pensando que la solución está en el Estado o en un político profesional de turno. Por eso latinoamérica no prospera, literalmente siempre se busca un mesías y siempre sale estatista. Nada más ver la época dorada de Argentina con Alberdi y el liberalismo multidimensional, y compararlo con la actualidad. Debería darnos vergüenza seguir pensando así y creer que dándole poder al corrupto se acaba la corrupción y el malestar."
1923,Espero que la gestión de Gustavo Petro arroje algún cambio positivo y no sea un chorro de babas como lo fue AMLO en Mex
1924,"En el caso de los petristas, que son los que yo más he tratado, ellos no entienden que otras personas tienen otras visiones del mundo, que uno no comparte las premisas con las que ellos entienden la política o la sociedad. Por ejemplo ellos creen que supuestamente Duque se inventó los asesinatos de líderes, y que es Duque el que mata a los líderes, entonces creen muy ingenuamente que si Petro llega a ser presidente, esos asesinatos se van a acabar. Cuando la realidad muestra que los asesinos de los líderes son bandas criminales de diversas pelambres, entre ellas, las guerrillas, y que, en tanto esos grupos existan y operen, seguirán ocurriendo esos asesinatos. Es solo un ejemplo de muchos."
1925,[deleted]
1926,Este post es culpa de petro.
1927,"No creas, a nosotros tampoco nos gusta Petro, a quién en su sano juicio le gustaría ese tipo, más de caudillo tiene Uribe.

Pero viendo lo que ha sucedido en elecciones, encuestas y lo quemado que está Fajardo luego de sus guiños hacia el Uribismo, yo votaría por Petro una y mil veces, sencillamente porque el primer paso del largo cambio que se necesita es castigar en las urnas a las ratas de toda la vida, cosa que nunca ha sucedido lo que explica su descaro.

Un voto para un tibio que quiere tener a los Uribistas contentos no es un castigo, es un premio a su omnipotencia.

Y un voto en blanco o para alguien que nunca va a ganar las elecciones, es darle otro mandato para Uribe, sea cual sea la justificación. Esa es la realidad."
1928,"Porque no hay nueva sangre con posibilidades reales de llegar a un alto cargo, si no apoyas a Uribe entonces se piensa que deberías apoyar al segundo con más posibilidades de ganar, e igual si no apoyas a Petro.

Y lo de que si no estás con uno estás en su contra son cosa, lamentablemente, de los fanaticos que hay en los dos bandos no pueden sacar sus cabezas de sus culos y por eso piensan que Uribe o Petro son la única cosa que hay, lamentablemente son los únicos que que tienen una visibilidad alta."
1929,"Hay tanto fanatismo en la protesta que a veces creo que si se tuvieran que operar de urgencia, lo unico que les preocuparía es que el cirujano fuera de izquierda.

Yo estudié economía y por formación sé que la derecha funciona mejor, mientras la izquierda  vende mentiras, pero no soy fanático y si hay un buen líder de izquierda lo apoyo, como en las elecciones pasadas que le voté a Ospina en Cali (aunque este segundo periodo resultó decepcionante), para eso reviso datos y la percepción de la gente.

A Uribe lo acusan de infinidad de mentiras pero uno revisa su gestión como presidente y fue más que aceptable. Mientras otros como Petro solo sacan disculpas cuando fue alcalde."
1930,Estoy harto que me llamen paraco por dar mi opinión no petrista
1931,"Bueno yo creo que el tema tiene un poco más fondo y creo que es donde se aprovechan los dos lados, realmente es que siempre existe parte de las sociedades que quedan completamente desatendidas.

Si te fijas desde la constitución del 91 no se ha logrado avanzar en algún cambio sustancial en cómo funciona nuestro país... 

La función del órgano dedicado a legislar no genera nada que realmente requiera la sociedad y suba quien suba a la presidencia no va a cambiar eso.

Creo que es necesario pensar más en un modelo de democracias directas donde la sociedad periódicamente se le consulte cuál es el rumbo y las necesidades, creo que es es la clave para romper este ciclo de siempre pensar que un grupo es el que nos resolverá todo y que todos tomemos nuestras responsabilidades dentro de la sociedad.

Y desde que sigamos bajo este mismo modelo siempre de un lado van a atacar el otro, creo que el mayor triunfo para ellos es generar esa división.

Saludos"
1932,"Porque estamos en un pais donde solo pueden existir los extremos y el que no se encuentre en ellos es tildado de ""tibio""."
1933,"Panita, ¿querías ver un mierdero en los comentarios? Pues, lo lograste xd

Simplemente nadie está dispuesto a ceder, la moral juega mucho aquí, más que juicios informados son las identidades de las personas opinando."
1934,La gente no es capaz de no caer por el populismo barato.
1935,Que vivan los Tibios!
1936,Porque en colombia si o si tiene que ser o el asesino de petro o el asesino de Uribe . No entienden que la SOLUCIÓN es gente NUEVA . En el gobierno en el senado en la policía en la alcaldía en la fiscalía en las cortes etc
1937,"Mejor ni hablar con personas así de esos temas. (Para la salud mental)

Si preguntan ud se hace el loco. jaja"
1938,"Porque generalmente el que no le gusta Petro no lo hace por conviccion propia, si no por prejuicios, ya hay un comentario llamando a Petro y a Uribe asesino?  
Uribe totalmente de acuerdo, pero Petro? Veamos por que lo llaman asesino, lo llaman asi porque estuvo en el movimiento M-19 un movimiento revolucionario que es reconocido historicamente por haberse tomado el palacio de justicia, participo petro de eso? no, Petro participo de otras batallas y mato gente? NO.  


En este video Everth Bustamante congrecista del partido CENTRO DEMOCRATICO y ex M-19 con honestidad reconoce que PEtro no participo en ninguna batalla, era un ideologo, que estaba alli por la ideologia revolucionaria, mas se abstuvo de cualquier hecho violento.  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2S\_RGRFGFU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2S_RGRFGFU)  


Entonces la gente lo llama, asesino, chavista, socialista y demas mentiras que dice la prensa, como no reaccionar mal cuando alguien que se come todas esas mentiras dice no gustarle Petro?  


A Petro le tienen miedo porque se comen la vil mentira del uribismo de que nos va a volver venezuela (que en un primer momento ya estabamos igual o peor y que el mismo uribismo con su titere con programa como el chavista alo presidente ya nos hiso dejar ver que ellos son los que no volvireron asi)

Entonces a Petro le tienen miedo por eso pero Petro sabe demasiado de economia, acaso el mismo Duque no hizo bombos y platillos de su programa de venta de Aguacates al exterior cuando el mismo Petro en su campaña presidencial del 2018 ya advertia del peligro de que Colombia siguiera dependiendo del Petroleo y no del agro? que paso luego? pasamos unos años donde el petroleo bajo a perdida, que tenerlo almacenado era perder plata y al contrario el aguacate se vende a mucho mas que el barril del petroleo hoy en dia.   


Que es lo malo de Petro? Curiosamente los que mas estan diciendo que los petristas no escuchamos y que no vemos como otros podrian tener ideas distintas son los que nunca han escuchado las propuestas de petro, abrir su mente y dicernir si lo que dice Petro tiene sentido o no, solo es puro prejuicio porque si Uribe es blanco entonces por lo tanto Petro es la otra esquina, Petro es Negro, ustedes los disque indecisos solo quieren olerse los peos y sentirse los moralmente correctos, pero no hacen una verga para dar una solucion al problema."
1939,"Pues al parecer, y espero me equivoque, es mas un asunto de ""tradición"" el decantarse por un partido político y por tanto el ver que alguien quiera algo diferente es romper esa ""tradición"" lo cual genera malestar a esas personas acostumbradas a seguir con un patron de pensamiento preestablecido. 

Afortunadamente se que no eres el único que desea algo totalmente diferente y no comulga con ninguno de los dos ""bandos políticos"" (yo incluida), asi que no te desanimes que este cambio de pensamiento tomará un tiempo, tal y como lo mencionaste el país lleva decadas polarizado por tanto llevará un tiempo el que la gente se de cuenta que lo que necesitamos no es un ""partido político"" sino políticos honestos que realmente quieran hacer que el pais avance."
1940,Porque es una falsa equivalencia.
1941,Por que es un tibio marica
1942,"Creo que es porque entonces caes en la casilla de los verdes y se asume que apoyas a Fajardo (No digo que lo hagas, estoy siguiendo la cadena de pensamientos que he visto), y pues a Fajardo mucha gente no le agrada por razones preexistentes o por el tema del voto en blanco. A mí me desagrada la comparación Petro/Uribe, se me hace bastante desacertada, Petro será todo lo mamerto radical que quieran y consejero de Chávez pero eso no es comparable a un warmonger como Uribe ligado a tanta historia del narcotráfico en el país y con tantos vínculos con narcos o wannabe narcos actuales. 

Lo que quiero decir es que Petro da mala espina con su radicalismo, zealot and caudillo behavior, y teorías económicas, pero no es comparable a seguirle dando el país a un ente criminal como Uribe. Si las cosas se reducen a Petro y al que diga Uribe otra vez la verdad me da menos miedo Petro que seguirle dando rienda suelta a Uribe."
1943,Simple papi nosotros tenemos la necesidad de ubicar a los demás en un grupo los de derecha te preguntan y dependiendo de como respondas te ubica en un lugar u otro incluso sin saber que significa la derecha o la izquierda el centro etc tenemos la nesesidad de ubicar al otro en un grupo para juzgarlo y la gente no piensa que los ideales de una persona pueden ser mucho mas que alguien de derecha o de izquierda en el caso de Colombia lo que dice la gente es que si eres de derecha tienes que amar a uribe y odiar a petro y viceversa pero las personas no miran mas halla de eso una for.a de juzgarte y saver donde ponerte
1944,"Realmente en las reuniones qué he visto de la gente de primeras lineas, dialogoa.facilitados por las Universidades por ejemplo en Bogotá y por otros canales, NO se plantea Petro Como una Solución, simplemente en algunos casos Como Una transición pero lo q más se repite, es la discusión y acuerdos entre movimientos vecinales para buscar acuerdos y Una sola voz, qué Haga las demandas Al presente gobierno. Tienen claro q el comité del Paro qué hay actualmente NO Los representa a Todos y tambien tienen clarísimo qué Los judicializarán cuando esto acabe, por eso buscan verdaderos cambios!"
1945,Porque esto no es un país es un partido de fútbol!
1946,Yo creo que petro es mas del monton pero anda decicelo aun petrista te tilda de ciudadano de vien y un idiota lo mismo los uribistas estar en el medio es ser pendejo segun ellos
1947,"Así es. 

Me explicas por fa qué es Keynesiano?"
1948,De acuerdo.
1949,Gracias por tu opinion la gente cree con propuestas de alguien en contra del gobierno actual ya esta
1950,Ni petro ni Uribe cambiaran al pais. Colombia necesita votar por alguien de centro
1951,"¿Se crean criminales o nacen? ¿Cuál es la mejor manera de abordar el crimen? ¿Persiguiendo a los criminales que existen? ¿O impidiendo la creación de nuevos delincuentes? Idealmente ambos.

Los asesinatos no desaparecen porque se elige a un político de izquierda. Pero solo la izquierda tomará las acciones necesarias para evitar que se creen criminales a partir de circunstancias de pobreza. Asimismo, solo la izquierda abordará la brutalidad policial.

Es comprensible por qué la gente pensaría que si un ex guerrillera del M19 convierte en comandante en jefe de las fuerzas armadas daría como resultado un uso más justo de las fuerzas armadas cuando Petro ha estado al otro lado de ellos y policia en el pasado."
1952,"No papito, no salga con esas falsedades, nosotros no creemos que duque ""se los INVENTO"", nosotros sabemos que los asesinatos a lideres sociales ya ocurrian desde hace años, pero en el gobierno de duque se dispararon esponencialmente, y claro duque no los mata, ni es responsable indirectamente, es su patron Uribe quien en realidad manda y el o permite el asesinato de lideres sociales o si manda a grupos ya sea guerrila, bacrims y/narcos a matarlos, pueden ser muchos factores, ademas de eso en Colombia la constitucion el primer derecho es el de la vida, el gobierno esta en el deber de proteger a nuestros lideres sociales pero en este gobierno se nota un descuido y una negligencia por protegerlos.   
Estos lideres sociales que han muerto por ejemplo son quienes resguardan los paramos, ya sabes, gente que pone su vida para que no se las vendan a mineros y no te sepa el aguita a mierda..."
1953,Ha pero jugan 11 personas y ahi los parqcos y los guerrilleros se aman que ridicules aveces merecemos ser todo lo que somos la verdad  reitero aveces

1958,"El problema no es populismo, el problema es el resentimiento que la extrema derecha ha creado exprimiendo y ultrajando a la clase baja durante décadas,  lo que hace que a cualquier cosa diferente a esa nefasta derecha le sigan como es el caso de petro pues es la única alternativa visible con fuerza."

1961,">gente NUEVA 

¿Quién?"
1962,"Pues a mi no me gusta Petro por sus ideas de política exterior, claro el man no apoya a Maduro, pero se pone de estupido a hacerle RT a los chavistas disque para mostrar que la oposición es mala también cuando a esa gente la oprimen y violan sus derechos políticos más que el carajo.

También me da cosa de que Petro se ponga todo nacionalista de izquierda y quiera enviar a los venecos de vuelta a Venezuela, si una cosa buena ha hecho Duque es ayudar a los venecos si quiera dándole la oportunidad a los bebés y niños de convertirse en ciudadanos y a la gente que trabaja les ha prometió un camino hacia la ciudadanía, mientras que Petro ha dicho cosas como “hay que ayudar a Venezuela para que los venezolanos vuelva a su país” y eso más estupido no puede ser, no importa cuánta ayuda le dé el gobierno de haya seguirá violando los derechos de las personas además que ese lugar está en ruinas."
1963,"A la gente no le gusta petro por que perteneció a un movimiento con ideologías de socialismo democrático, y era parte del grupo que atacó el palacio de justicia, por sus políticas keynesianas, por su amistad con Chávez etc."

Es aumentar el gasto público para activar  la economía."
1969,"Gracias. Se que canso con mis testamentos aqui hahahaha pero no entiendo porque Colombia sigue a extremistas cuando nos hemos dado cuenta que ellos solo traen problemas en todo Latinoamerica. Tenemos siglos de historia para respaldar eso. En muchos paises de Central-Nordic Europe no tienen politicos extremistas y estan muy bien.  Amo como ellos siempre logran encontrar el Balance entre la Derecha/**Centro/Izquierda**. El Resultado? Son los paises con los mejores estandares de vida en el planeta.

Aqui debemos aspirar a ser un dia como Alemania/Canada/Netherlands/Switzerland/Sweden/Norway.........No un Cuba/Venezuela/Nicaragua/North Korea/Russia II"
1970,"> Pero solo la izquierda tomará las acciones necesarias para evitar que se creen criminales a partir de circunstancias de pobreza. Asimismo, solo la izquierda abordará la brutalidad policial.

la historia de muchos países demuestra todo lo contrario."
1971,"Gracias por hacer ese comentario, y mostrar el perfecto ejemplo de lo que quería decir. Una mirada muy sesgada y desinformada del tema, tal como dije.

Durante Duque no se dispararon los asesinatos de líderes. Han tenido una tendencia irregular. Bajaron en el 2019, 10% (y no estoy citando fuentes de gobierno, sino a Indepaz) y subieron en 2020.

Lo de que Uribe es quien los mata ni siquiera merece comentario. Pero ya que menciona a Uribe, vale decir que durante su mandato fue cuando los asesinatos selectivos tuvieron un descenso más marcado.

Excelentemente dicho, pertenecio, en pasado.

\>por sus políticas keynesianas

Te voy a ser 100% sincero, no tengo idea de que es el Kynesianismo y aun asi tengo dudas de si Petro tiene estas ideas o no, pero estoy abierto a que me explique con fuentes para ver a Petro de forma distinta. 

\>Amistad con Chavez.

Uribe tambien se saco fotos con Chavez y tuvieron sus amistades, pero nadie recuerda eso, Petro ha dicho que en venezuela lo critican porque no es amigo del gobierno de Maduro, Diosdadocabellos ha criticado a Petro, y aqui hay un video de PEtro donde critica el gobierno de Venezuela.

Apoyo a Petro porque se que es el unico candidato que invertira en educacion, y Colombia necesita salir adelante a punta de gente educada, no mas ignorancia para el pueblo.

1978,Se puede hacer como en otros países invertir en empresas públicas para una mayor rentabilidad del estado y con el tiempo flexibilizar los impuestos a personas naturales y jurídicas.
1979,Gracias por la explicación!
1980,"Europa y Canadá dice lo contrario.


Izquierda ≠ extrema izquierda


[la extrema izquierda y la extrema derecha son muy parecidas](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teor%C3%ADa_de_la_herradura#:~:text=En%20ciencia%20pol%C3%ADtica%2C%20la%20denominada,los%20extremos%20de%20una%20herradura.) 

Solo centro-derecha, centro, centro-izquierda son las voces de la razón."
1981,"No soy ni Uribista ni petrista pero hombre cómo vas a decir semejante barbaridad,  decir que los asesinatos selectivos bajaron en el período de Uribe es muy triste, y seguro los falsos positivos fueron un invento de los campesinos. Hombre todo sabemos que Uribe y sus fieles perros son los padres de las autodefensas, lo saben todos los colombianos y hasta la comunidad internacional. Pueden intentar hacerle un lavado de cara a la imagen de los uribistas pero ya están muy quemados y si no han salido del poder es porque se aferran a el con violencia. plomo de parte de la ""gente de bien""."
1982,"Fajardo no es tibio, no se engañe, apuesto y aseguro con mi vida que Fajardo es Uribista."
1983,"Porque alguien que quiere liderar tiene que transmitir solidez y tener posiciones claras. Y han pasado muchos eventos en los últimos 4 años donde Fajardo se ha quedado callado ni ha emitido declaraciones rechazando o condenando cosas.

Antes me parecía centrado, ahora me parece sencillamente un agazapado que intenta mantener apariencias y quedarse callado para no disgustar a nadie y parecer la opción menos polarizante... Sin saber qué realmente representa esa opción menos polarizante."
1984,"Jajaja y ""violo"" esa es nueva.

1985,Hay gente que cree que Keynes es socialista porque socialismo es cuando el estado hace cosas.

1987,"Es como  criticar a Uribe por sus nexos con los paramilitares, pero decir que petro perteneció al m19 el cual tenía ideologías de socialismo democrático y decir no petro ya no es así. 

Obvio que Uribe es corrupto pero con petro no tienen ese mismo racionamiento. Por pertenecer a una de las guerrillas de Colombia que quemó el palacio de justicia puede que petro no estuviera en el ataque pero igual hacia parte de esa organización y por lo tanto es condenable.


https://youtu.be/hAx9cbpJCS0

En este vídeo  petro asiste al funeral de Chávez de no ser tan amigo no hubiera asistido, lo de Uribe con Chávez es más protocolo, es más se ha escuchado a petro decir que el error de Chávez solo fue depender del petróleo.


Lo de invertir más educación, y otros gastos que él quiere hacer suena muy bonito pero eso se paga con más impuestos, que tiene que pagar la gente del común que ahora está marchando por los impuestos.


Lo que no saben es que las empresas en Colombia son las que mayor carga de impuestos tienen en Latinoamérica. Por lo tanto si a las empresas les ponen muchos impuestos o se van o quiebran.

Y también más impuestos para la clase media 
Que no quiere pagar más impuestos


Otra cosa de petro es que cree mucho en imprimir dinero y eso crea inflación y pérdida del valor de la moneda."
1988,"Las empresas públicas se costean con nuestros impuestos con la plata que recogen de la gente, de las empresas y si tiene perdidas se mantiene con la plata del estado, aparte que quieren menos corrupción pero quieren más estado y burocracia."
1989,"Lo que es una completa estupidez, una completa imbecilidad y necedad es negar aquellos asesinatos bajaron considerablemente durante el Gobierno de Uribe cuando le estoy mostrando los datos. 

¿Usted sabe leer?"
1990,"No es necesario, eso lo sabe todo mundo, y sus seguidores, puro uribista de closet."
1991,"A ver lo que digo es que se puede replantear como gestionar una parte del presupuesto general de la nación que por cierto se aprobó el año pasado de más de 300 billones de pesos, para invertir en empresas públicas eso sí con veeduría y auditoría de las cuentas. Pero no se pueden robar los 50 billones ni tampoco dejar sin ejecutar parte de ese presupuesto, y viendo este gobierno pues esta claro que van a seguir mal gestionandolo todo."
1992,"Yo pienso que el estado es muy grande y eso permite la corrupción y petro quiere aumentar el estado y aumentar el gasto. lo qué propones sería bien pero estamos en Colombia, hay mucha corrupción, no confío en los politicos siempre se van a robar plata y si se pierde la plata por robo o se pierde la plata por que el negocio no funcionó perdemos todos, además con todos los gastos que va que tener que tomar el estado para que termine el paro y más la pandemia no se qué tanto quede para invertir, pero ya veremos qué pasa."
1993,"Bueno no se donde viste eso de Petro que quiere aumentar el estado, pues él y el sector alternativo piensan en eliminar muchos puestos públicos por ejemplo en los consulados del exterior y eliminar gastos como de camionetas para los congresistas y sus sueldos. Si hablas de reducir el congreso sería bueno siempre y cuando que procuren tener un total suficiente de representación ciudadana, eso debe ser debatido con calma. El gasto público puede ser alto pero eficiente, por ejemplo en países como Dinamarca que es como del 54% del PIB. El presidente puede ser Petro o cualquier alternativo pero lo importante es que el congreso que es el que debate las leyes sea la mayoría de los partidos independientes o de oposición actuales. Esperemos que el otro año cambie las cosas."
1994,Es bueno ver que aún hay personas en este sub que hablan sin insultos y generan debate educadamente. Felicitaciones chicos!
1995,"Estoy de acuerdo con la reducción de gastos inútiles, cargos inútiles y beneficios a políticos, deberían bajarse tantos puestos innecesarios y reducir el sueldo tan alto de senadores, representantes, montón de pensiones  que se pagan a expresidentes que ya son gente con dinero etc.


Ahora que el gasto público y el estado va ha aumentar eso es seguro, según su propuesta.

https://youtu.be/j-yUUIM7idU

En esta entrevista mencionaba su plan de gobierno para el 2018. Allí hay varios puntos en los que se va a aumentar el gasto al estado, crear más estado y subir más impuestos.

En Dinamarca hay políticos menos corruptos, además que pagan gran cantidad de impuestos."
1996,"El gasto público tiene que aumentar de manera transparente si o si, la falta de voluntad política ha precarizado la economía, salud, educación, etc. Yo se que en Dinamarca pagan muchos impuestos, pero yo estaba hablando del gasto público, acá podemos potenciar el agro porque tenemos muchas más tierras que ellos para producir y exportar alimentos. Y con no solo subir impuestos pero para grandes patrimonios y riquezas, hay que evitar la evasión, y eso sería un alivio para el recaudo tributario, podríamos crecer como nación sin duda si tenemos en cuenta los puntos que te digo.

Con el video no me simplificas el por qué quería tener más estado, algo que me llama la atención, porque ya te comenté que la oposición hoy por hoy buscan reducir mayormente los cargos públicos. 
Yo no soy de Petro pero no me parecería una locura si él llegara a ser presidente porque pues es de los que más estaría abierto al dialogo y consensos en estos aspectos fundamentales que he dicho, eso si, no hay que votar por los partidos que hoy son la mayoría en el congreso, eso es lo realmente importante."
1997,"El gasto público debería aumentar respectivamente con la capacidad del país, cómo sabe se cayó la reforma tributaria que iba a recaudar dinero para el gasto público,   si el gobierno se pone a imprimir dinero sería mal para la gente y aumentar la deuda pública peor.

Evasión siempre va haber, cuando hay personas que  tienen la capacidad de mirar y analizar los huecos legales, la subida de impuestos provoca la fuga de los capitales.

En el vídeo se comenta que se van a crear empleos directos con el Estado por sus propuestas de salud y educación.

Tampoco soy un fan de la reforma pensional que el propone.

Potenciar el agro está bien, pero yo pienso que este país debería tener más fácilidades para el emprendimiento y crear productos con valor agregado. No sólo quedarse en materias primas, se debería hacer más énfasis en el sector de servicios."
1998,"Las cosas han estado tensas en Colombia y en el Subreddit :(

Espero no sea por mucho"
1999,Life is hard....
2000,"De eso se trata este subreddit, de eso se trata este país. Acá usted no puede tener una opinión conservadora porque lo acaban a punta de downvoting..o lo censuran los ""moderadores"". Esto está plagado de SJWs y political correctness. La doble moral por delante."
2001,Dígalo sin llorar
2002,"de hecho está llena de gente polarizada, gente que solo es A o B, oiga hay que ser uno muy plano y vacío para que eso suceda, y lo peor es qje este subreddit está lleno de eso, una lástima porque hay gente que está dispuesta a debatir pero los mods los censuran ."
2003,Estoy en contra de la corrupción.
2004,"Pues habia prometido no volver a postear nada politico por temor a un ban lol pero solo una ultima vez....

Estoy en contra. Ambos lados no quieren solucionar nada-poner de su parte y si esto va para largo pues adios a Colombia como lo conocemos porque caera en una crisis economica mas grave de lo que causo el Covid-Las Reformas. Yo creo que la mejor manera de arreglar las cosas es votar por alguien que no sea del centro democratico o extremista en las siguientes elecciones que ya son pronto. Los extremos han creado cosas como bolsonaro-trump-chavez-amlo.

Contra los bloqueos de las carreteras estoy totalmente en contra porque quiebra a las personas que menos tienen. Quien le va a responder a todas esos cientos de familias del agro que perdieron todo en Cali y ahora no tienen como vivir?  quien le va a responder a todos los que tienen tiendas de ropa y dependen del traslado de sus mercancias? quien le va a responder a la señora que vendia empanadas y ahora por los precios esta quebrando??? Aqui los derechos de unos no valen mas que los otros. La lucha va contra los politicos no contra los congeneres. Al mismo tiempo como es que Duque hace nada por los camioneros? que le cuesta? un cerdo.

Lo de que Colombia esta mal no viene de duque unicamente. Esto es de decadas y hasta ahora hizo ignicion. Yo no recuerdo que Colombia estuviera muy bien cuando estaban pastrana-samper. La Mezcla de los Politicos de Derecha y las Farc por decadas han llevado al pais a la ruina. Tambien no debemos ignorar que el mayor problema esta en varios de los Congresistas-Senadores-Las Cortes de este pais.....

Lo de las marchas es totalmente valido porque el pais esta muy abandonado y Uribe-Santos-Duque lo desangraron de una manera monstruosa favoreciendo solo a sus amigos ricos por años. Por otro lado hay ciertas personas en esas marchas con objetivos netamente de sembrar una Colombia comunista y algunos pagados por guerrillas-eln. Lo digo porque sigo bastantes del paro en redes sociales y tengo ~~familiares envueltos en eso.....~~

En twitter me han atacado ambos lados de la manera mas violenta asi que no quiero saber de ninguno de los 2. Horrible como el extremismo de Derecha-Izquierda se le mete a las personas. Tambien es un asco como Uribe-Petro han ayudado a incendiar el pais en vez de apagar las llamas. Que les suspendan los twitters. Tambien al ministro de defensa y bolivar.

Solo quiero que esto se detenga y se acabe el covid y Colombia de alguna forma mejore. Extraño la vida de antes que aunque era un desastre pues........ Colombia es un pais con cosas muy bellas yo no lo quiero abandonar."
2005,"Me siento neutral. Tiene cosas buenas, tiene cosas malas. Me gusta la oposición al Uribismo, pero no me gusta la falta de orden o de ideas claras, realistas y articuladas por parte de los manifestantes. Tampoco siento que el paro tenga un propósito consecuente y claro en este momento, y muchas veces se siente que sigue más por momentum que por logros reales o concretos (obviamente en gran medida por culpa de un gobierno de mierda, pero también en parte por ser un movimiento descentralizado y a veces ambiguo). 

Es incómodo intentar trabajar y comer en un país en paro, pero más incómodo es hacerse el pendejo a las verdades de este país, por eso no critico a los que paran. Yo necesito trabajar y el paro sí me ha afectado negativamente, no voy a mentir. Pero no es como que hacerse el ciego y creer en el gobierno más mediocre e incompetente que he visto en mi vida sea una solución realista. 

No puedo marchar, tengo que seguir trabajando (hay que comer), y además me gusta mi trabajo. Me niego a darle la razón al gobierno que está matando gente en las calles, pero no veo avances de ninguna manera con el paro, y parece que mientras no haya figuras de liderazgo fuertes que organicen la cosa, no va a llegar a nada. El paro necesita líderes, estrategas y personas con el poder de unir y convocar. La masa no logrará mucho así."
2006,Apenas ocho votos 😅. Yo creo que las manifestaciones se pueden juzgar separadas del paro y de sus versiones en diferentes ciudades. No es lo mismo quejarse de los efectos de algo en Cali que en Medellín no tiene los mismos efectos
2007,"Una buena parte del problema es que dependamos tanto de las carreteras.

Al país le falta una infraestructura ferroviaria, que debido a las cordilleras no es nada sencilla de hacer, pero tampoco imposible.

Es increíble que tantas cosas se dupliquen o tripliquen en costo debido a que tienen que ser cargadas en tractomula por sinuosas y peligrosas carreteras, y esto seguirá siendo cierto cuando se acabe el paro.

En Colombia todo es caro, hasta lo que se produce aquí mismo, y la dificultad del transporte debería ser la principal preocupación de los próximos 5 gobiernos."
2008,"Samper fue un cáncer para Colombia, cuando llegó el desempleo era del 7% y cuando salió fue del 16%, Pastrana lo dejó en 19% y Uribe lo bajó al 11%, Santos lo alcazó a tener en 9% un año pero con la pandemia se subío al 15%.

Hay muchas mas cifras para debatir y que si estudia quedará mas uribista que uribe."
2009,"Gracias por esa opinion tan significativa. desconocia eso.   
Habia leido que los camioneros tienen como un **tipo de monopolio** y por eso en Colombia no tenemos casi trenes. Es eso cierto?  
Pero si ponemos vias ferroviarias no se irian todos a la calle? que se haria ahi? eso me parece bastante terrible.   


Yo estudiaba por el norte de Bogota y siempre veia pasar el tren ❤️ Love them.  


El otro dia estaba checando google maps en 3D y seriamente Colombia es un infierno topograficamente. Tiene unas montañas enormes y casi todo esta bloqueado por elevaciones."
2010,">Hay muchas mas cifras para debatir y que si estudia quedará mas uribista que uribe.

Bajo Uribe el desempleo ""bajó"" sólo si se toma en cuenta la informalidad, que creció en gran medida bajo su gobierno y que en muchísimos casos no alcanzaba (ni alcanza) el salario mínimo.  La industria manufacturera y el comercio bajo Uribe *decrecieron* 6.3% y 2.9%, casi todo el crecimiento económico ocurrió en la extracción de petróleo y la minería por parte de extranjeros. La desigualdad durante esa gestión también incrementó, llegando a posicionar a Colombia como el quinto país más desigual del mundo."
2011,"No necesariamente es por el monopolio de los camioneros.

El terreno es difícil, esa es la principal razón.

Y pues para comprar un camión se necesitan unos cientos de millones de pesos y se pone a trabajar.

Mientras que para invertir en vías férreas se necesita mil o diez mil veces más dinero, coordinación y poca corrupción.

Es más bien que hacemos lo que podemos, cada uno a su manera, cuidando sus propios intereses, pero a la hora de organizarnos nada."

2013,"Clase media y pobre. Los ricos/upper class pueden sobrevivir hasta que se agoten sus ahorros,pueden irse del pais o tienen propiedades en arriendo de las cuales viviran.

Mi tio que trabajaba en el agro en Cali fue despedido asi como un monton de familias-conductores-galponeros. El esta pensando en irse para canada-bogota-la costa tiene buen curriculum y contactos........Los trabajadores de esas empresas? a mirar como buscan trabajo en medio de una crisis traida por pandemia  en una ciudad casi destruida (Cali) y seguro tienen varios hijos que alimentar.

Tambien de acuerdo con que el paro destruyo la reputacion del centro democratico. Esto fue como el maximo golpe para Uribe. Aunque por otro lado yo siento que si esto se alarga mal y empiezan a cerrar todas las empresas-negocios por la crisis las personas se iran es a la extrema derecha y los Paramilitares creceran enormemente y ahi si dara miedo. Se imaginan un Bolsonaro para Colombia?"

2016,"Repite la encuesta, mismas opciones de respuesta, pero con alguna de estas preguntas:

* ¿Quiénes fueron los más afectados por la ley 100?
* ¿A quiénes afectarían más las fallidas reformas tributaria y a la salud?
* ¿Quienes son los principales afectados por los excesos del ESMAD?

Esas te darán respuesras similiares, ¿verdad? Y qué pasaría si las preguntas fueran:

* ¿Quienes recibieron la mayor cantidad de ayudas del gobierno durante la pandemia?
* ¿Qué sectores tienen las tasas de interés más bajos de préstamos del Banco de la Repúlica?
* ¿Quiénes se oponen más a que vengan entidades verificadoras de derechos humanos?"
2017,"Los ricos, los pobres y la clase media ya venían de bajada"
2018,"ay me equivoque y le di en empresarios, pero tambien son afectados"
2019,"Pues nada más les cuento, mi papá es independiente y trabaja con varias empresas, una de ellas es una empresa de transporte que venía mal desde la cuarentena y cuando por fin se estaba recuperando llegó el paro, y hace poco quebró y tenía una nómina de 60 empleados, la mayoría de ellos conductores de buses que han trabajado toda la vida en eso y que dudo puedan conseguir empleo en lo que saben hacer en este momento tan difícil del país, imaginen que como esas 60 familias, hay muchísimas otras que hoy no tienen sustento"
2020,"En un paro la clase media y los trabajadores, son los que hacen los mayores esfuerzos y quienes más invierten, sin embrago, son quienes mayores ganancias pueden obtener si persisten en la búsqueda de sus derechos. Sí no son ellos quiénes los defienden y los buscan  nadie lo hará por ellos."
2021,La guerrilla ha sido la más afectada positivamente
2022,Te faltó poner la economía

2026,Eso no será nada si en las próximas elecciones la gente no aprende la lección y vota por los mismos.
2027,La solución es ahorcar al pueblo?
2028,"La reputación de Petro 

(si es que un ex empleado de Pablo Escobar puede tener alguna)"
2029,"Le puedo empezar por responder desde lo que sé sobre la Ley 100 y sus efectos. Toda Colombia fue muy afectada, positivamente. Permitió aumentar el gasto público en salud; incentivó la inversión privada en el sistema; tuvo un impacto social significativo, cerrando la brecha en el uso del servicio de salud; promovió la protección financiera del sistema lo que ha permitido cubrir enfermedades de alto costo; la cobertura en salud creció muy significativamente; el gasto de bolsillo en   
 salud de los colombianos actualmente es de los más bajos en América Latina.En esa época la esperanza de vida en Colombia era como de 63 años, hoy en día es de 79 años. Muchos otros indicadores de salud del país demuestran un impacto muy positivo.

Con respecto a su segunda pregunta, es mucho más complicada la respuesta porque ambos proyectos de reforma tenían muchos puntos, sobre todos se podía discutir su conveniencia o no. Por ejemplo Claudia López alabó recientemente varios puntos de la reforma tributaria que se cayó.

Su tercera pregunta es una pregunta capciosa.

La cuarta pregunta, los más beneficiados fueron mipymes que pudieron cubrir diversos gastos de seguridad social, por ejemplo. Esas pequeñas y medianas empresas constituyen la gran mayoría de las empresas del país. Y también la gente que recibió subsidios directos.

La quinta pregunta me hace entrever que usted no tiene claro cuáles son las funciones del Banco de la República, y que está hablando por hablar en ese caso. Habla del BRC como si fuera un banco privado y, nada que ver.

Sobre la sexta pregunta, no sé, dígamelo usted. Lo cierto es que los organismos de DDHH como Human Rights Watch no han comprado el cuento de los grupos de manifestantes que han querido vender la idea de que Colombia es una ""narcodictadura"" y han dicho que apoyan y esperan que el Gobierno colombiano investigue y castigue los abusos policiales."
2030,Gracias a la ley 100 yo tanto estudiando como desempleado tengo acceso a un medicamento de 6000 dólares al mes que me permite poder mover mis articulaciones por la artritis y solo pago 3400 pesos de cuota moderadora para cada aplicación.
2031,creería que solo los pobres y clase media + mipymes estaban por reventarse.
2032,"Quise decir. Ha destruido el Centro democratico aun mas. La reputacion ya esta destruida hace varios años jaajajaj  


Tengo varios familiares uribistas que les parecio tan abusivo lo de las reformas que pensaban hasta salir a la calle. Aunque muchos no lo crean hasta los Uribistas estaban contra esa cosa pero las personas no salieron por el problema del **covid-19**. Tambien a varios les enojo que duque no hiciera nada con lo de los paros por tanto tiempo (osea militarizar-conmocion interior)  y ya no creen que los candidatos de Uribe sean aptos para el pais porque todos les salen Judas (Esto lo vi en twitter)  Su partido esta quemandose.  


El otro dia discutia con mis familiares sobre eso. Ok les acepte que Uribe ayudo a que el pais no fuera controlado por las FARC hace decadas pero hizo algo mas??????  


Su partido lleva 20 años dominando:  
La educacion malisima...salud-EPS malisima....la brecha entre ricos y pobres enorme......los falsos positivos......lo del agroingreso......campo abandonado.....Santos llego y robo mas (No entiendo como ese señor tiene un nobel) y ahora Duque con amigos como este [señor](https://www.elespectador.com/resizer/kJVYMOC1peNQllQFyYJrXXU7pI8=/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-elespectador/public/GAVGEFFZDRG27GTEGTMEH3JEFI.jpg).   


Es muy claro que el Centro democratico ya no traera nada bueno a Colombia. Yo votare por alguien que no tenga que ver con Uribe-Duque-Santos en las siguientes elecciones. Eso si jamas petro. Ese señor no me gusta nada. Sigo su twitter y Las ideas con las que sale para Colombia son 0 viables economicamente y nos llevarian a la Ruina aun mas. Si por el fuera se pondria a imprimir dinero para mejorar la economia.

*** Mobilization of bikers in Bogotá, in support of the National Strike ***

*** If you do not see thousands of people on motorcycles, expressing their support for the National Strike, who also do it in complete order, without damage, without affecting public order, I am sorry, you are part of the problem. This is the true image of Colombians and citizens who are tired of being abused by representatives of a bad government, who ask for a change and love their country. There are many other demonstrations like this one, every day in a city in Colombia, where hundreds or thousands of people go out to ask for a true change and better social, economic, educational, health conditions and that they do it in the most orderly and calm possible way. There are others, contrary to the idea, that cause damage and take advantage of the opportunity to cause all kinds of situations that delegitimize just social protest. Colombians who want a new and better nation are more of us.***"

¿De qué está hablando? Con esa frase estaba haciendo referencia a las peticiones del Comité del paro, ninguna de las cuales tiene que ver con reabrir la frontera.

La segunda frase que cita hace parte de otro párrafo y de otra discusión, y además también la sacó de contexto y no hace referencia al cierre de la frontera, sino al hecho de que usted dijo que había que desarrollar el comercio con Venezuela y hacer regresar a los venezolanos a su país (con lo cual se contradice con respecto a lo de reabrir la frontera). Yo sí creo que la frontera debe estar abierta, Duque la cerró por la pandemia, Maduro la ha hecho cerrar varias veces. Pero dinamizar el comercio con Venezuela depende de que exista una economía en Venezuela, y esta cada vez se contrae más y más.

En ese mismo hilo hizo lo mismo, sacando de contexto y tergiversando varias cosas que dije. Le respondí de vuelta, lo refuté, y no respondió más. Aquí está la discusión: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Colombia/comments/n9lvzj/seguimos\_en\_pie\_de\_lucha/gxt501a/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Colombia/comments/n9lvzj/seguimos_en_pie_de_lucha/gxt501a/?context=3)

&#x200B;

>Ahora resulta ser que el gobierno anunció que va a abrir las fronteras con Venezuela aplicando normas de bioseguridad. O sea, mágicamente después del paro desaparecieron todos los riesgos por COVID que mantuvieron dichas fronteras cerradas por más de un año

O de pronto ahora el Gobierno tiene una capacidad de hacer testeos mucho mayor que la que tenía hace un año, por ejemplo? Además de haber negociado y asegurado más de 70 millones de vacunas.  
  


>La realidad es que el gobierno empieza a mostrar su desespero porque sabe que tiene que reactivar la economía a como dé lugar y especialmente en Cúcuta,

O de pronto ese es el trabajo del gobierno? Intentar dinamizar y reactivar la economía, y buscar un equilibrio entre actividad económica y salud.

>la situación del gobierno es particularmente débil porque se quedó sin las cartas de acusar al gobierno venezolano de reprimir la protesta pacífica.

¿? Lo siento, Chávez, pero no. Los abusos de DDHH en Venezuela no dejan de existir en razón de lo que suceda en Colombia. Igual Colombia está en la OEA y en otros organismos, y eso la obliga a tomar parte en las denuncias y medidas contra esos abusos, de la misma forma que tiene que responder por los abusos aquí.

Lo que cita de Maduro no demuestra que tenga ninguna sartén por el mango, demuestra que Venezuela también cerró su frontera, contrario a lo que usted decía.

Mirando en su historial de posts también miré por encima y descubrí otras estupideces que dijo en otras discusiones, como que ""la reforma tributaria se aprueba al todo o nada"" (completamente falso)."
2097,"Esté abierta o cerrada la frontera con Venezuela, es lo mismo. Aunque cerrada es más peligroso en general, te lo dice alguien que ha vivido toda su vida ahí."
2098,"Se le olvida que ahorita en la frontera está una de nose cuantas disidencias de las FARC dándose palo con el ejército venezolano al tal punto que casi toda la gente de un pueblo venezolano se tuvo que venir aca, no lose Rick, eso no da ganas de abrir la frontera"
2099,"Hola. No entiendo por qué la molestia, si incluso tuve la gentileza de hacer una mención a u usuario para que estuvieras al tanto de lo que publiqué. 

En realidad no tengo ganas de discutir contigo. Creo que tenemos distintas interpretaciones de la discusión y, sin ánimo de ofender, no creo que estés discutiendo de buena fe. Yo literalmente inicié mi argumento con la siguiente frase:

>... debería Duque, por ejemplo, dejar de pendejear con lo de Maduro y los derechos humanos y abrir la frontera para que se dinamice el comercio con Venezuela... Nada más por ahí tienes cientos de millones de dólares para empezar a cerrar la brecha fiscal. 

Luego mencioné un conjunto de acciones que **yo** considero pudieran ayudar a recaudar fondos distintas a las que aparecían en la reforma tributaria original incluyendo - y esta es una idea enteramente propia, basada en evidencia y que mal pudiera yo endilgársela al Comité del Paro - de legalizar el cannabis e imponer fuertes tributos a su consumo y comercialización. 

Culminé la lista señalando que:

>El Estado tiene herramientas a su disposición para hacer frente a la crisis. 

**Unas herramientas que claramente partieron de mí - /u/Beginning_Beginning - no del Comité del Paro**. ¿Qué carajos iba a saber yo (o cualquiera de nosotros si a ver vamos) cuáles eran esas propuestas en ese momento? Y sin embargo tú empezaste a responder cada uno de **mis** puntos: ""impuesto a las bebidas azucaradas, puede ser, puede que no...""; ""medidas y proyectos en curso para reducir los gastos de funcionamiento del Estado ya hay varias...""; ""lo de impulsar el comercio con Venezuela no tiene sentido..."", y culminaste escribiendo que ""en general no hay razón para que el Gobierno 'conceda' así como así ninguno de esos puntos. Son cosas que requerirían muchísimo más debate y deliberación"".

Seamos serios por favor. ¿Ahora resulta ser tú estabas era respondiendo los puntos del Comité del Paro? ¿De dónde salió eso y cómo alguien podría saberlo?

Tú expusiste las razones por las cuáles lo de impulsar el comercio con Venezuela no tenía sentido, yo expliqué por qué tu razonamiento era errado y tú contra-argumentaste señalando razones adicionales. Es todo parte del mismo hilo de discusión. Estoy al tanto de la frase ""Obvio que yo creo que debe estar abierta"" pero ello no concuerda con la idea de que ""impulsar el comercio con Venezuela no tiene sentido"" cuando yo enlacé no una sino cuatro fuentes de empresarios colombianos solicitando apoyo al ejecutivo a lo largo de un año para que se abriera la frontera y así impulsar el comercio con Venezuela. Ya ahí no había más que responder, tú hiciste un comentario basado en suposiciones personales que no se sostienen a la luz de los hechos (y a la final tuve yo la razón, Duque abrió la frontera). 

Con respecto a lo demás no voy a comentar. Guarda esta conversación y revísala periódicamente cuando veas lo que va a pasar con Guaidó, con las elecciones de alcaldes y gobernadores en Venezuela, con la bajada de tono de las acusaciones de Colombia hacia Venezuela y el cambio de actitud del grupo de Chile, con la mejora del comercio binacional luego de que el gobierno colombiano se vea obligado a negociar de tú a tú con Maduro y se le olvide el gobierno interino y toda el cuento de los derechos humanos (que Colombia también se pasa por el forro).

A la final a los hechos no les importan los comentarios formulados en Reddit por un par de desconocidos."
2100,"Lo ideal dicta que un gobierno debería tomar las mejores decisiones para garantizar el bienestar de los pobladores. 

Una visión más pragmática (más cínica, aunque más ajustada a nuestras realidades) es que un gobierno debería tomar las mejores decisiones que le permitan mantenerse en el poder, lo cual uno esperaría que implique garantizar el bienestar de los pobladores para que estos los vuelvan a votar en las siguientes elecciones.  

La gente que ha leído este post y le ha hecho downvotes quizás no se ha dado cuenta de que, la ineptitud de Duque es porque no ha sabido tomar decisiones adecuadas, por ejemplo en materia de COVID (el bienestar de las personas), pero aún si no le importase el bienestar de las personas, más importante aún es que no ha tomado las decisiones adecuadas que debería haber tomado si quiere mantenerse en el poder. 

Puede que estando la frontera abierta o cerrada con Venezuela sea lo mismo, pero la percepción de la gente vale muchísimo y hay cosas que son indudables: uno, que Cúcuta está vuelta mierda y el cierre de frontera le dio durísmo; dos, que la gente de Cúcuta lleva un año rogándole a Duque porque abra la frontera; tres, que el Norte de Santander es crucial en el plan electoral del Centro Democrático para las elecciones del 2022; cuatro, que el gobierno así lo reconoce y - a pesar de haber dicho lo contrario hace apenas un mes cuando Duque ""definitivamente descartó esta posibilidad"" - le tocó volver a abrir la frontera; cinco, que lo hace desde una posición débil, con una imagen internacional seriamente opacada, pero negándose a negociar con Venezuela y apoyando a un gobierno paralelo venezolano que la Unión Europea dejó de reconocer en enero. 

De paso, está contra el tiempo en bajar las tensiones y reactivar la economía porque aún no ha acabado el paro y mientras tanto está tratando de mejorar la imagen del país y sacar una nueva reforma tributaria que tiene que pasar sí o sí y pronto, porque si no Fitch y Moody's también van a calificar la deuda colombiana como BBB- lo cual sería fatal. Para rematar, estamos en medio de un tercer pico de pandemia que está matando a 500 colombianos todos los días y que de repente obliga otra vez a cerrar los pasos por concepto de cuarentena (con todo y que ya ni nos acordemos). 

Esa es la realidad, yo no entiendo qué es tan difícil de aceptar. Como le dije al otro usuario: guarde este post y veremos cuál va a ser la actitud del gobierno de Duque frente al de Maduro en los meses por venir, vamos a ver cómo evoluciona el conflicto venezolano este año electoral, vamos a ver cómo Guaidó sale como corcho de limonada."

Los downvotes a menudo ocurren porque a la mayoría de cuentas en este sub no les gusta leer posts de las fronteras, Cúcuta, Catatumbo o Norte de Santander cuando el autor es diferente a un extranjero. Suma que recordás las malas decisiones del gobierno y luego citas otro redditor con el que tuviste argumentos y obvio votarán con todas sus multis.

2134,"Una supuesta defensa de la democracia no puede servir como pretexto para argumentar que ""nadie los votó"", ese moralismo nadie se lo cree. Claramente nadie los votó porque son rebeldes, no participan en la vida civil. Así como un líder indígena o uno afrocolombiano difícilmente lograrían representación en el senado sin escaños especiales para ellos (como dice la Constitución que debe ser), a un exguerrillero también se le debe garantizar la participación si se reconoce que las causas de la sublevación eran legítimas (las cuales lo son, el hecho de que se haya implementado el Acuerdo de Paz demuestra que el Estado reconoce que las causas de las Farc eran legítimas). En ese sentido, la representación de las Farc en el Congreso es más comparable al de las minorías étnicas que a las de un parlamentario cualquiera en virtud de que reconocemos que fueron un grupo oprimido y por tal motivo deben tener representación especial, por aquello de garantizar la ""no repetición"".

Pasó lo mismo en Irlanda, en España con el ETA, en Uruguay con los Tupamaros (grupo al que perteneció Pepe Mujica) pero solo en este país tenemos la tara mental de pensar que los guerrilleros no pertenecen a la sociedad o que aparecieron porque sí, puestos a dedo por un dios malo porque sí, que los malos eran los campesinos de Marquetalia.

Los crímenes de guerra fueron hechos por el oficialismo (que aún sigue en el poder) y de eso hay amplias pruebas a nivel nacional e internacional pero por ellos sí no se escandalizan porque se ven decentes, estudiaron afuera y son, en términos generales, más lindos que los guerrilleros."
2135,"Es una falta de respeto comparar a líderes sociales y a minorías étnicas en su amplia mayoría pacíficas a traidores violentos, criminales culpables del asesinato de Miles de civiles, los crímenes perpetrados por las farc son más comparables a aquellos de los nazis en el frente occidental que a la consecuencia de alguna pelea idealista, además independientemente de que tuvieran ideales puros o de qué se les haya oprimido en un pasado distante lo que hicieron no se puede borrar, sólo un porque un grupo haya Sido oprimido en el pasado no significa que los crímenes y atrocidades que cometan están justificadas.

No parece justo parar una guerra sin consentimiento popular, no parece justo permitir que criminales de guerra tengan puestos de poder sin elecciones y tampoco parece justo que aquellos que les pagan el sueldo sean los mismos a los que atormentaron desde hace años.

Todos los insurgentes tienen buenas intenciones no significa que sus actos se justifiquen automáticamente ni que se les deba reconocer o premiar de ninguna forma.

Los crímenes de guerra del oficialismo si bien existieron fueron ampliamente casos aislados, no un modus operandi como lo fue con las farc, la principal fuente de reclutamiento de las farc era casi exclusivamente el secuestro de niños campesinos, eso ya es un crímen de guerra según el estatuto de Roma así como la toma de rehenes (práctica común entre las farc)  Así cómo atentados a la población civil o bienes civiles, el desplazamiento forzado y la instalación de minas antipersonales en áreas civiles, también son crímenes la ejecución de rehenes y prisioneros, la tortura de prisioneros y tratos degradantes hacia ellos. Esta es solo una fracción de los crímenes que han cometido estos traidores aunque por poco y violan todos los estatutos"

2139,"Entiendo su descontento y lo comparto, vivimos en un país con muchos desafíos y dificultades. También es cierto que tenemos una clase política cuyo objetivo de enriquecer sus círculos prima sobre el bienestar general (tanto el gobierno y la oposición). Sin embargo, la economía sólo es una y un país próspero  tiene que ser rico. El esfuerzo fiscal por la pandemia se ha notado. Si bien Colombia tiene solidez en cuanto sus recursos primarios, no tenemos las condiciones para depender de ese sector. El paro ha puesto en relieve la necesidad de aliviar las cargas al ciudadano de a pie, sin embargo, ha gestado un descontento en otros sectores, las riquezas de los países dependen de la solidez de su sector privado. 

El cambio debe verse en las urnas, voten por expertos, gestores y buenos administradores, no se dejen llevar por el discurso populista, además recuerden que un países está compuesto por diferentes factores de poder, los cuales a través del consenso deben alinearse.

2145,"Yo no estoy de acuerdo con los bloqueos de carreteras. Afectan millones de personas. Si eres privilegiado y no te pasa nada no significa que no le este ocurriendo a otros en el pais. Todos los struggles son importantes. Una gran cantidad de empresas con cientos de empleados estan a punto de irse a la bancarrota. Esas Familias importan y Perder empresas en un pais es irse a la ruina economica. En muchas ciudades hay desabastecimiento de muchas cosas. Una minima subida de los precios en todo puede afectar negocios enteros y hasta a la señora que vende las empanaditas-almuerzos. Aqui en mi ciudad hasta tenian problema con los pacientes renales por falta de medicamentos. Te imaginas tu mama estuviera ahi?  Aun asi entiendo a a los camioneros porque el gobierno lleva años abusando con los Peajes. Aqui duque es el que deberia hablar con ellos y darles soluciones. Llevamos 20 dias? y nada se soluciona..... lo que es grave. A duque le importan 0 las empresas prefiere hablar con fajardo,politicos de altas esferas o de la Copa America. Un presidente serio hace algo pero no deja que esto vaya tan lejos. Yo fuera el presidente andaria en reuniones todo el dia-todos los dias con ellos hasta llegar a algo.

Si duque hubiera sido menos soberbio y menos desconectado de la dura realidad del pais esto no habria pasado. El vive en una burbuja donde todo esta bien. Es tan solo ver ese programa que llevaba por meses y a nadie en el pais le servia pero el seguia porque queria su talk show. El tipo tendra estudios pero es un bruto bruto. Le falta humildad. Le falto escuchar a las personas y no solo sus amigos politicos.

Si las personas marchan deben hacerlo como estan haciendo en Bogota que cambian de lugar llevando awareness a todo lado. En ibague se dedicaron a quedarse en un solo espacio y estan afectando terriblemente todos los negocios aleñados. Aqui el gobierno no sufre son las personas porque a duque le vale \*\*\*\*. Tambien las marchas deberian enfocarse donde viven los politicos ricos? entes gubernamentales?

Mis respetos a los que marchan que mantienen el distanciamiento-tapabocas. Shame a los que se lo quitan y se ponen a hacer reunion social poniendo en riesgo la vida de sus padres-hermanos-tios. Hay que ser muy ignorantes para no tomar este virus en serio en especial ahora que no tenemos UCIs.

Los del Esmad-Policia deberian quedarse en sus casas por 2 semanas. No Salir. Si los estan enviando a matar ellos deberian decir NO. Asi se acabaran las muertes. La marcha es pacifica entonces supongo no veremos ningun problema.....  Ellos tienen que no dejar que el matarife los use como carne para sus planes. Estoy de acuerdo en que se necesita una Reforma y no solo aqui en Colombia.

No debemos olvidar que Duque no es el unico culpable de esto. Santos-Uribe-Pastrana-Samper-El Congreso-Las Farc-Billonarios Colombianos.......Aqui son varios que tienen al pais en ruinas desde hace varios años. Todo el batch de politicos ricos-familias ricas  en Colombia son culpables de esto. El Olvido a los campesinos-estrato bajos-medios-educacion-comunidades afro......"

¿Logros del paro? Que se cayeron los proyectos de reforma tributaria y de salud... bueno, eso es sólo parcialmente cierto porque igual ya estaban casi desplomados por falta de apoyo en las bancadas del Congreso. El tema de la matrícula cero creo que estaba contemplado en la reforma que se cayó."

De la misma manera la prevención se limita a aquellas prácticas que son económicamente rentables, no a aquellas que no lo son (como preparar el sistema de salud para una pandemia).

2) Claro que duelen los muertos por COVID, pero mas que las concentraciones de gente lo que mata es el desastrosos sistema de salud, donde los pobres no reciben atención y los centros de salud no tienen recursos para invertir en prevención. Ni el mejor ni el peor gobierno pudieron haber respondido a esta crisis porque fueron mas de 20 años de ley 100 acabando con la calidad del sistema de salud. Si no fuera por las politicas impulsadas por la ultra derecha colombiana, ciertamente hubieran habido mas UCI para atender a las personas. 

3) Sobre las cifras de policias heridos, se de primera mano que cuando los afectan gravemente sus propios gases lacrimogenos pasan las cifras de heridos. Lo mismo que en el Hotel que incendiaron, no fue a proposito, fue un mal manejo de las armas que usaban para inculpar a los manifestantes los que causaron dicho incendio y las lesiones relacionadas. Sumele los infiltrados heridos por sus propios compañeros. Los culpables de dichas lesiones no son los manifestantes, los culpables de dichas lesiones son un gobierno indolente que se ha negado a hablar con la gente desde el día 1 y hoy se les salio el país de las manos. La gente protestando esta haciendo justicia, los policias su trabajo, los ricos estan haciendo el país añicos."
2168,">y bajemos del poder a esa clase puerca que nos ha gobernado por 200 años

Eso no tiene sentido. Los problemas de Colombia son estructurales, cambiar a las personas al mando o que llegue un mesías que pretende arreglarlo todo, no va a cambiar de fondo las cosas.

El otro día publique un post para generar debate de una ONG que dice, con referencias las protestas son creadas por los Castro chavistas, y esa publicación tenía unas fuentes mucho más creíbles que tú post de facebook, debo creerle también? Creo que yo me quedo con un medio internacional independiente como CNN.

Según el WEF Colombia tiene el segundo mejor sistema de salud de la región. Puesto 16 a nivel mundial. Lo siento pero si bien falta mejorar, el sistema de salud colombiano no es el problema. No le creas todo lo que dicen los políticos.

Los gases lacrimógenos rara vez se consideran una herida, en la mayoría de casos no pasa de ser una quemadura de primer grado. Las heridas de los policías son por falta de entrenamiento y agrecision con piedras y otros elementos, o se te olvidó que hace unos días quemaron con cóctel Molotov a un grupo del ESMAD, si las protestas son pacíficas para que llevan un cóctel Molotov?

El tema de los infiltrados me da mucha risa, sabes para que meten infiltrados la policía a las protestas? Para identificar a los vandalos aprovechados que solo quieren generar disturbios, porque recuerda hay gente que solo quiere ver el mundo arder, y hay gente a la que le conviene que se mueran 400000 gallinas, que el precio de la comida se duplique y que las industrias entren en crisis, cuentame quien se beneficia de una situación como está, y creo que ya sabes que pasa, porque a la fecha el gobierno ha hecho todo lo que los protestantes piden y cada día salen con algo nuevo."

También comentó sobre otros puntos pero siendo sincero no presté mucha atención al resto."

1) Es previo a la pandemia  
2) No tiene en cuenta prevención como parte de un sistema de salud (así que en Col. tenemos practicamente el mismo nivel que CHina, según el informe)

Ahora es aún más fuerte, con más médicos, mayor cantidad de camas y espacios habilitados, o crees que los hospitales y edificaciones que invirtieron simplemente se desaparecieron o van a desaparecer al finalizar la pandemia?

La prevención era uno de los puntos principales de la reforma a la salud, que los protestantes tumbaron. Si había otros puntos terribles, pero este central es interesante que vuelva."

2218,"La verdad creo que falto tener en cuenta muchas variables en la cifra del paro. No solo porque ya lleva casi el triple de duración que tenia en la toma de ese dato, sino porque también solo representa las perdidas en ventas que estiman los comerciantes, es decir no tiene en cuenta los daños a bienes públicos que también hay que pagar. Por ejemplo, solo en Bogotá se tendrán que gastar mas de 20.000 millones en reparar el Transmilenio nada mas, y eso sin contar la posibilidad que en los siguientes días sigan vandalizando el sistema^(1).

Entonces más interesante que la cifra de 50 billones, sería saber dónde y cuanto se están robando en cada entidad y que ojalá la protesta se extienda a todos los que nos roban."

2235,"No soy experto en la materia, pero entiendo que el informe es por el 2018, creo que en presupuesto de la nación que indican ahí es de cerca de 840 billones y lo que mencioné en el comentario anterior era solo a modo de ejemplo, porque hay otros dos hallazgos de 66 billones y 15 billones, pero no los mencioné porque no entendí muy bien de qué eran"
2236,"Que se halla presentado en 2018 no significa que todos los eventos ocurrieran en ese año (a menos que sea documento distinto al que me refiero, se habla del periodo 2014-2018). El pgn para 2021 es de 320 billones, decir que hay hallazgos de 66 billones es como decir que prácticamente se desapareció todo el presupuesto destinado a educación o a salúd.

Aquellos que apoyan los disturbios también etiquetarán a los alborotadores como manifestantes pacíficos para ganar simpatía por un grupo de vigalantes violentos.

No sé qué está sucediendo en este video exacto. Pero el alcalde ha estado en diálogo abierto con los manifestantes pacíficos. Sin embargo, 5 personas que fueron a la comisaría le prendieron fuego. La policía y los ciudadanos que se oponen al incendio de su ciudad se enzarzaron en una confrontación con estos vándalos. El alcalde alega que las mismas 5 personas fueron a su casa y lo amenazaron.

Es genial decir ""fuck the police"". Pero si crees que tener un grupo violento de vigalantes que quieren incendiar la ciudad y matar a todos los que discrepar con ellos (incluidos los funcionarios electos que simpatizan con los manifestantes) es de alguna manera mejor que la policía a cargo), estás loco.

Debe haber una reforma Fiscal y Política. 
Que se acaben esas pensiones multimillonarias del Ejecutivo y el Legislativo. No más pensiones a ministros, presidentes y congresistas. 

La corrupción en Colombia debe ser sancionada con medidas más severas. La precariedad estructural (vías, salud, educación) se debe a la plata que se ha llevado la corrupción. 

El voto en Colombia debe ser obligatorio. La abstención es funcional para la politiquería de siempre. En Colombia la política no funciona haciendo las mejores propuestas para convencer a la mayoría, en Colombia la política funciona ""manteniendo aceitada a una pequeña maquinaria votante"". 

De nada sirve que la gente proteste si cuando tiene la oportunidad de expresarse el día de las elecciones no lo hace."

Pero cuando hay saqueos, convenientemente ni se asoman. Hasta me pregunto cuánto durarían los bloqueos sin esa confrontación permanente."
2248,"Bueno... Tengo esto atravesado en el pecho desde hace rato así que supongo que mejor lo saco todo acá...

Para aclarar todo creo que ideológicamente soy anarquista y de manera pragmática soy liberal... Así que la idea seria reducir el tamaño del gobierno gradualmente hasta que desaparezca por completo.

Con respecto a lo que pienso sobre lo que esta pasando actualmente (e incluso desde hace más de 10 años) en Colombia... Creo que la ""política"" acá se asemeja más a barras bravas e hinchas que a política de verdad, la gente ve en su caudillo la solución a todos los problemas y en el caudillo contrario la fuente de todos los problemas, pero como ud dice : 

>nos resulta imposible pensar que toda propuesta o pronunciamiento no lleva un interés en sus carreras, un cálculo sobre lo que les conviene o no.

Y yo opino exactamente esto, el estado es inherentemente corrupto, este en el bando que este, el que se suba al poder dificilmente va a  buscar la reducción del poder del estado, e inevitablemente lo va a usar para promover su agenda, haciendo más grande al estado, ya sea Uribe promoviendo la guerra contra las drogas y el conservadurismo social o Petro con progresismo y su idea de redistribuir la riqueza; pero lo peor de todo es que esto no es un problema que surja de los políticos, ellos solo son empresarios que buscan complacer a su clientela. Es decir, los políticos son el reflejo de lo que la gente quiere. 


Creo que tanto la ""derecha"" como la ""izquierda"" tienen el mismo problema, lo único que quieren hacer es inflar más al estado, quieren más programas para X o para Y, que inevitablemente lleva  a mayor carga tributaria para todos y por consiguiente jode a todos menos a los políticos. 

En cuanto a la fuente del mal que actualmente nos aqueja, La reforma tributaria, está tenía contemplado lo que Petro, Gustavo Bolívar y todos los de ""izquierda"" andaban pidiendo: Una renta básica... pero claro, debido a que eso es gasto estatal solo hay dos opciones para financiarlo, o con más impuestos, o con emicion monetaria.... Pero cada bando ve lo que quiere los de ""derecha"" dirán que duque quiere ayudar a los pobre y los de ""izquierda"" ven que les quieren subir más impuestos.  La protesta y el descontento social por todo esto está totalmente justificado, y me alegra que Duque pierda apoyo, el problema es que la gente no está pensando en acabar con la raíz del problema (el estado), si no que quieren llevar el poder al ídolo que ellos adoran (esto aplica para ambos bandos). 

Los lideres del paro tienen un montón de peticiones que obviamente Implican aumentar el tamaño del estado y por con siguiente el gasto pueblico, pero claro, ellos no van a necesitar ningún impuesto ni van a tener que emitir dinero para financiarse, para ellos la plata crece en los árboles... Y quieren redistribuir la riqueza en un país que no tiene ninguna.

La solución a todo esto? No la veo cerca, seguramente moriré antes de que suceda, pero creo que habra que llevar acabo una revolución cultural donde la gente deje de creer que el estado es el la gallina de los huevos de oro que solucionará nuestros problemas, cuando la gente se de cuenta que la raíz de todos los problemas es el estado y que solo destruyendolo seremos libres y más felices podremos comenzar a ver un cambio... 


Perdon por la verborrea, tengo en mente varias acciones concretas que políticamente apoyo, pero no veo que nadie esté pensando en eso"
2249,"En esencia estoy completamente de acuerdo con usted en cuanto a que la ciudadanía tiene que participar mucho más activamente, y empezar a organizarse mucho más desde lo micro. Además, pasar de la mera protesta o de disentir, a organizarse para proponer, deliberar, crear ideas aterrizadas y basadas en información rigurosa sobre las necesidades del país. Y en que no se puede esperar que un mesías llegue para arreglar todo, cosa que obviamente no va a pasar.

Pero las reformas y leyes no son solo un papel. Esas reformas y programas definen muchas cosas; la gente tiene que ser partícipe de esos debates; con organizar actividades micro de tipo comunitario no basta, para nada. El sistema tributario, pensional o laboral y las reformas que se van a hacer sobre esos temas, nos conciernen a todos y tenemos que informarnos muy bien sobre todo eso."
2250,"Me parece curioso que casi todos los comentarios vuelven una y otra vez a alternativas políticas, ¿por qué?

Ahora educar a los niños oara que sepan decidir a un buen candidato y no por un partido político, también me gustaría que si el candidato no cumple con sus propuestas que lo bajen de su cargo, estaría bien y en varios países hacen eso.

Más soluciones sería mejor educación, hacerle revuelta a la cámara de justicia, aprobar pena de muerte para curruptos, violadores, etc. Así que las personas tengan más miedo y más valor a la vida. Y elejir a un buen líder, no a otro mandado por uribe, si no les gusta ningún candidato boten en blanco peor nunca vendan sus votos, valen más de lo que piensan"

-Contratos con el estado no pueden completar si gerentes, dueños o empleados son gente/personas encontradas culpables de sobornos o corrupcion. 
-Usar parte de ese dinero para Educación y acceso a prevencion de reproduccion sexual desde los 13 años a niñas y niños. El camino a la pobreza en colombia es la reproducion.

2258,"Como dicen u/Perro_amarillo y u/criloz en sus comentarios.... Las fuerzas antimotines son comunes, si las quitan los militares o policías armados serán los que tomen su lugar... Lo que hay que hacer es cambiar a su jefe (que actualmente es el gobierno central)...  Cada gobierno local debería tener su fuerza pública ajustada a su necesidad... Con eso pasan 2 cosas

1. Es más fácil que localmente de manera democrática se reforme cada entidad policial de la región

2. Es más fácil responsabilizar al gobierno local que al nacional"
2259,"Desmontar al Esmad ¿para qué? ¿para que ahora sean fuerzas militares y policiales que no tienen ningún entrenamiento en antidisturbios, las que estén en las protestas? Eso significaría muchos más muertos y violaciones de DDHH.

O desmontar al Esmad para crear otro Esmad con otro nombre, hacer la del bobo, cambiarlo todo para no cambiar nada.

No sé a qué se refiere con que los grupos policiales antidisturbios no se ven en  países ""civilizados"". Precisamente las fuerzas antidisturbios se inventaron en países desarrollados."

2263,"Yo antes era anarquista,  ahora soy minarquista, el anarquismo  solo funciona si todos los países del mundo lo fuesen, pero eso nunca va a pasar además   se necesitan las fuerzas militares.  Colombia lo que si necesita es descentralizarse y pasarle más poder a las regiones, posiblemente dividir la figura del presidente en dos, un jefe de estado  que sería elegido de forma directa y un jefe de gobierno que sería elegido por la cámara y el senado,  así es mucho más fácil que el país se ha gobernado mediante consensos y se pase rápida las legislaciones. 

 Pero lo único que va a sacar a Colombia del atolladero es volverse indispensable en el comercio mundial, dejar de solo exportar cosas sin valor agregado, petróleo, café, flores, etc.  Y aprovechar la posición geográfica  que tenemos,  volvernos un centro de logística para Latinoamérica,  un puente entre USA y Brasil que están entre las 7 más grande economía del mundo."
2264,"El primer paso debería ser reducir el Estado, reducir el número de congresistas y representantes de cámara, tenemos que? Como doscientos setenta y punta? Es injustificable y de ahí se pierde mucho dinero y además da oportunidades a más eventos de corrupción y es más difícil de investigar y judicializar debido a la cantidad de acusaciones solo por persona. También se debería reducir el sueldo de los funcionarios públicos, específicamente del congreso, un senador no debería tener un sueldo tan alto por el sencillo hecho de que no es una posición a la cual se deba aspirar por su recompensa monetaria. 

Con solo esos primeros pasos el Estado empezará a recuperar algo de dinero y no tendremos que estar al borde de la bancarrota cada semestre."
2265,"No soy anarquista esencialmente porque creo que hay temas y problemas en lo político que no pueden ser simplemente resueltos desde lo civil, un poco como la pregunta que hace caes95 sobre la justicia; creo que aún si una sociedad lograra volverse anarquica, eventualmente surgiría una estructura que haría las veces de Estado
Sobre el problema de los políticos y su interés de aumentar su poder, por eso creo que la ciudadanía debe estar más organizada: los contrapesos no deben ser solamente entre instituciones del Estado sino entre la sociedad y ese Estado
Por último, no creo que la ""derecha"" y la ""izquierda"" quieran ambas ampliar el Estado: la derecha busca el Estado más mínimo, que permita el desarrollo económico privado, globalizado, mientras la izquierda si está más interesada en fortalecer un Estado que tenga un papel más dinámico"

2267,"De acuerdo contigo, no era mi intención en el post decir que ""lo político, las leyes y las reformas no sirven para nada""; como le contesté a otra persona en los comentarios, no soy anarquista. Y sin duda, no podemos dejarlo tampoco quieto mientras fortalecemos la ciudadanía: hay que trabajarle a todo de forma simultánea.
Mi inquietud es que estamos tan enfocados en pensar leyes, pero no en las instituciones y el tejido social necesario para que sean efectivas: por ejemplo, la Constitución establece que el derecho a la vida es inviolable, no hay pena de muerte, hay un montón de aparatos legales e institucionales para velar por esto, pero culturalmente somos tan violentos que igual andamos en la calle con cuidado porque ""no sabemos quién es el otro""; eso no se resuelve con más policía, ni con penas más severas sino con construcción de tejido social, con un cambio cultural. Si, desde arriba, desde la política, también se puede promover esos cambios, pero me gustaría que nos pensemos qué podemos hacer desde nuestra esfera de influencia como ciudadanos, como individuos"

2269,"Pero pensemos por un momento esos otros Estados en los que la corrupción no es el mismo lastre que aquí, donde los recursos se logran invertir de forma efectiva en la sociedad. ¿Qué hay de distinto? he escuchado gente hablar de que habría que ""traerse políticos del extranjero"", como si el problema fuera simplemente de los políticos. Claro, la corrupción y la mala administración corre por cuenta de los políticos, pero eso es un fenómeno social, no natural: no son corruptos simplemente por ser colombianos.
Lo que creo es que en estos otros estados la sociedad civil es más fuerte, no simplemente que la gente esté más enterada, sino que hay iniciativas civiles que ayudan a construir identidad, tejido social y veeduría a los políticos; eso nos falta acá, y eso nos toca construirlo a nosotros"
2270,"Pareces desconocer que la misma Constitución prohíbe la pena de muerte, y que ese tipo de castigos no son más que populismo punitivo, como la dichosa cadena perpetua a violadores. Sin  duda se necesita una reforma a la justicia, pero la imposición de penas más severas no sirve"

Hacer de Colombia una federacion, que no esten subordinados al ministerio de defensa si no al gobierno local"

2276,"Yo creo que más que pensar alternativas al ESMAD es que este realmente funcione como debería: primero que todo, respetando sus propios protocolos, y segundo, que no se despliegue constantemente para todo y sobre todo para sabotear manifestaciones.   
Aparte de eso, no como alternativa al ESMAD sino como estrategias antes de recurrir al ESMAD, sería importante que los gobiernos locales pudieran tener una comunicación más efectiva con los organizadores de marchas y ayudarles a establecer... ""controles internos""? que les permitan a los mismos manifestantes evitar los vandalismos en las protestas"
2277,"Ninguna. Los países civilizados no utilizan escuadrones antimotines, es una salvajada latina que sólo sirve para provocar a los manifestantes.

Si hay una reduccion en ese gasto pues no sabemos que pasara con esa platica porque igualmente en el estado corrupto todo ese dinero no se va reedigir a sectores que se necesiten.

En un mundo ideal que se cumpla que las ramas del poder público sean verdaderamente independientes. Que el presidente no este poniendo a cargo a sus amigos porque genera acumulacion de poder.

En cuanto a los salarios, no sé todo lo que tengan los congresistas, pero tampoco podemos pretender reducirles el salario tanto que prácticamente haya que pagar para ser congresista: ahí si que se complica la corrupción. Y tampoco eso va a ""financiar"" al país.

Ahora yo considero que los términos derecha e izquierda sólo logran poner a la gente una contra otra... Creo que la discusión más productiva se da desde el marco de ""los que quieren dejar a la gente en paz"" y ""los que no quieren dejar a la gente en paz""... Así nos daremos cuenta que no es los fachos contra los comunistas, sino la gente contra los políticos ladrones.

El anarquismo en el estado actual es inviable eso lo reconozco... Por eso digo que soy ideologíamente anarquista, sin embargo creo que debe ser una meta a la cual, con el tiempo, nos acerquemos cada día más.

Antiguamente la justicia funcionaba con arbitrajes privados (así es como un partido de fútbol), los árbitros que tuvieran fama de ser justos e imparciales ganarían fama y  serían contratados de manera más frecuente.

En cuanto a cómo llegamos allá? Lo primero sería fragmentar el poder del estado, eso significaría federalizar Colombia, si cada región gana independencia es más difícil que un tirano corrompa todo el país de un solo golpe, lo siguiente sería reducir el poder del estado central eliminando ministerios o fucionandolos, esto les gustaría a los de izquierda porque la policía dejaria de ser problema del ministerio de defensa y sería problema de gobernaciones o alcaldías locales"

 SEMANA conoció que este jueves, en Cali, hubo una reunión entre el Comité del Paro nacional, el Comité de Paro del Valle del Cauca y algunos integrantes de los llamados puntos de resistencia.

 Allí se acordó una detallada estrategia para alargar las protestas de manera indefinida, pese a la crisis humanitaria y de desabastecimiento en algunas regiones del país y los polémicos bloqueos.

 El primero plantea que el paro hay que ""Repotenciarlo con la acción unitaria de masas del próximo 19 de mayo"".

 En el segundo se habla de la negociación con el Gobierno nacional como una ""táctica"" y dejan claro que hay que plantear ""Las líneas rojas en torno a las garantías para la movilización y la protesta social como precondicionamientos y la participación de sectores que van más allá del CNP"". En el tercer punto del acuerdo proponen un ""Fortalecimiento"" con la incorporación de nuevos sectores sociales y populares, ""Proyectando pliegos regionales"", lo cual claramente alargaría cualquier conversación que pueda darse.

 Aunque el Comité del Paro no le ha contado al país sobre su nueva estrategia, hoy se filtró a los medios de comunicación y generó una gran alarma por el impacto que puedan seguir teniendo estas protestas y bloqueos en la vida de millones de colombianos.

2310,"Querer garantías mínimas no tiene realmente nada que ver con no querer dialogar. Antes de buscar una solución al problema de fondo, lo mas importante es buscar que no se siga asesinando a la población, o que el gobierno no pretenda seguir emboscando al comite.

Miralo así, ¿crees que las FARC y el gobierno de Santos hubieran llegado a un acuerdo de no ser porque los diálogos se llevaron se hicieron en Cuba, que sirvio de territorio neutral? No se hubiera llegado a un pacto si se le hubiera solicitado a la guerrilla que para dialogar iban a tener que entrar en una base militar colombiana. Eso es una garantía"
2311,"la verdad con este paro se han levantado un montón de fenómenos polémicos, en muchas partes aprovechan para hacer peajes o pedir plata, la misma gente del paro debería controlar esto sabemos que no son todos pero tampoco se dejen desacreditar de esa manera :/"
2312,No es legal pero es legitimo. Los del paro dejan entrar comida y medicinas por un cordón humanitario pero no material de guerra. Ya cogieron un camión lleno de llantas y material para la policía en una caravana de mulas que supuestamente cargaban comida. Si no les llegan balas no pueden matar pelados.
2313,"Aunque esas peticiones son muy bonitas, altruistas, y necesarias, me parece que no van a solucionar ningun problema:

1) No hay ni un solo punto relacionado a la lucha contra la corrupcion.

2) Encender la maquina para imprimir billetes solo va a traer mas problemas que soluciones, pues el peso se va a devaluar considerablemente y eso trae inflacion.

3) A lo bien le confiarian el uso de las reservas internacionales a este gobierno? En el 2020 no se vendio buena parte del oro de Colombia, y donde estan los resultados?

Creo que se necesita un poco de coherencia en el discurso y dejar esa mentalidad de corto plazo."
2314,"Pues esas propuestas que proponen para financiar todo el gasto que plantean son exactamente las mismas que se han aplicado en Argentina durante mucho tiempo, por gobiernos varios gobiernos.

Y el resultado ha sido terrible sólo una fotografía del último año inflación cercana al 45%, y devaluación del 80% de la moneda.

2351,"De acuerdo con los otros posters. Por ejemplo en mi caso la pandemia pegó duro y unas semanas antes del paro pude volver a trabajar. Empezó el paro y nos tocó dejar de ir. Yo debo atravesar la ciudad de sur a norte y uso el mío para eso. También está que el precio de los alimentos subió exageradamente y lo que antes te alcanzaba para dos días ( hablo del dinero) ya no alcanza sino para una sola comida para 4. En Siloe hay personas que están sin insulina por ejemplo y no tienen cómo movilizarse para ir a reclamar o por lo que no hay paso no está llegando la medicina. Yo hoy fui a reclamar mi medicina y había gente que no le pudieron dar completo porque no habían podido pasar los camiones.  Aquí a todos nos está afectando esta situación , no es cuestión del encierro como dicen muchos , es cuestión de que están afectando al resto del pueblo con esos bloqueos y daños a diferentes partes. En mi sector hay ya 3 panaderías y varios restaurantes que durante pandemia pudieron sobrevivir pero que por el paro ya tuvieron que cerrar porque se quedaron sin materia prima."
2352,"Vivo en el sur de Bogotá y trabajo en el norte y la verdad aquí todos o la gran mayoría de trabajadores viven en el norte y uno los ve muy relajados, por más que intenten evitar que la gente llegue a su trabajo no lo han podido lograr y lo único que están haciendo es afectarnos a quienes nos toca atravesar la ciudad de un extremo a otro tanto para salir a nuestro lugar de trabajo como después de una larga jornada tener que llegar mamados caminando porque los desocupados están bloqueando las calles y saboteando, en ese orden de ideas digo que es una cosa inútil el joder las clases bajas y trabajadoras y que las personas que están por el norte siguen haciendo sus vidas como si nada pasara, es más aquí se habla de paro mañana pero en la oficina no les interesa nada y pues muchos van a venir porque aquí en el norte nadie viene a joder a esta gente, nos están es fastidiando a nosotros loa clase baja y nos siguen jodiendo para llegar a nuestra casa."
2353,Primero la pandemia y ahora el paro. Hay gente que necesita ir a trabajar para darle de comer a su familia para pagar la renta y más cosas de necesidad. Hay gente enferma que necesita movilizarse y medicina. El paro fue muy mal organizado y solo está  afectando a las comunidades de bajos recursos. Los que trabajan en el gobierno o tienen dinero e influencias ya salieron de colombia ya están en Europa o en estados unidos tranquilos.
2354,"Como con cualquier movimiento politico siempre toca yener en mente a quien se quiere alcanzar con el mensaje.

2355,"Creo que la gente no entiende lo que significa los problemas de movilización.

El principal problema en la ciudad es el bloqueo. La libertad de movilización es un agravante, pero el verdadero problema es una ciudad bloqueada donde no están entrando alimentos, combustibles ni **insumos médicos** (en plena pandemia)

2356,"Entiendo completamente estás posiciones y son completamente validas al punto de que se reconoce que el bienestar de los grupos familiares particulares priman sobre ciertos factores generales. Sin embargo, hay ciertas cosas de fondo que me hacen pensar que en si esas posiciones radican en el sobrevivir y no en el  vivir de manera digna,.la gente que es empleadora debe tener un mínimo de empatía ya que al estar desde el privilegio, se les nubla bastante la perspectiva y adicionalmente se refuerza con la perspectiva y necesidad de las demás personas. Y bueno, si necesitamos para el subsitir diario, pero eso es una solución a corto plazo, pregunto yo, ¿Qué pasaría si  ya no lo necesitan a uno más? Lo más factible es que lo desechan y uno se queda sin nada. Ahí, entonces,  cambiaría la cosa, entonces, independientemente que afecte de manera sustancial muchas cosas del diario vivir, lo importante es saber que si queremos que esa desigualdad no se perpetúe más, toca obligar el cambio, tanto primero en uno, y luego en los demás. Porque si perpetuamos la desigualdad ahora con nosotros, nuestros futuros hijos, sufrirán lo mismo y se continúa el ciclo."
2357,"Si, es normal. Hay personas que necesitamos trabajar. Esos bloqueos que se estan haciendo en las ciudades solo es un ""tiro en la rodilla"" a la misma clase media-baja. Los politicos, a los que se les quiere mandar en mensaje, estan en sus fincas o fuera del pais. El bloquear una calle no va a traer a los martires caidos, y tampoco va a traer el peso de la ley a los responsables. Hacer que el metro o el transmilenio dejen de funcionar solo afecta a jovenes y clase trabajadora. Hay formas mas inteligentes de protestar y enaltecer sus memorias: como votar masivamente en el 2022, usar mecanismos democraticos como referendums, consultas, plebiscitos, entorpecer campañas electorales, y enviar las pruebas necesarias a los entes indicados para que se judicialicen los culpables. Se que hablar es muy facil...Pero esos bloqueos son muy desgastantes para el mismo pueblo."
2358,"Los que quieran protestar, pueden hacerlo frente al congreso, frente a la casa de Nariño, o frente a propiedades de reconocidos políticos. Este paro es una Hidra deforme, sin objetivos claros, mucho bochinche y pocos resultados."
2359,"Parce, la gente lleva movilizandose sobre estos problemas por años entorpeciendo lo menos posible el día a día de la ciudad. Pero nadie mueve un puto dedo más allá de cuidar sus intereses y los de sus familias. Están matando gente puta madre! Estamos camino a una dictadura que saca la policía todas las noches a matar gente y ustedes pidiéndoles que no hagan ruido? Eso es como ver una persona desangrándose y pedirle que no haga regero. Descarados."
2360,"Los que están parando no son niños ricos tampoco, también son gente que necesita ir a trabajar para darle de comer a su familia, pagar la renta y más cosas de necesidad. No vagos, no holgazanes, gente como usted que además de sufrir lo mismo que usted están parados re duro en las calles. Se lo digo yo que trabajo, tengo una mamá que necesita medicinas y atención médica constantemente y protesto.
La cosa es que esto no cambia si nadie pone nada de su parte. Ahora usted no marcha, no aguanta ni balas no bolillasos, ni siquiera aguanta el esfuerzo físico que implica salir a marchar. Sabe cuál podría ser su granito de arena a qué las cosas cambien con este paro? Apoyar los bloqueos a pesar que lo afectan."
2361,"Así es, como siempre el que lleva del bulto es el pobre."
2362,"Exactamente estos manes con sus bloqueos pendejos nos están es jodiendo a nosotros los de menos recursos, los de recursos altos tienen como afrontar una carestía en alimentos pero como la afectación no es solo para ellos, lo que están intentando hacer es no les sale bien y causa todo lo contrario, igual ya verán que todas esas reformas van a ser aprobadas de una u otra forma y por más que se den las vidas de muchas personas esta vaina no va a cambiar, a ellos no les importa el pueblo."
2363,"Pero es que por eso, es un paro, no hay lógica que unos paren y otros no. O todos en la cama, o todos en el suelo. Adicionalmente, a los campesinos nunca desde hace muchas décadas , cuentan con la posiblidad de sacar sus productos de manera tranquila. Entonces eso es una falacia de que los productos se pierdan, pierden los distribuidores intermedios que compran el producto menos de lo que cuesta en realidad."

¿Conocés qué es la Navaja de Ockham?

> *«en igualdad de condiciones, la explicación más sencilla suele ser la más probable»*

Es decir, seguramente son protestantes. Las protestas no son iniciativas con un liderazgo claro. Pueden haber muchos buenos y unos pocos mal intensionados. Eso se vió muy claro en los primeros días que mucha gente se entró a robar a los almacenes de cadena en Cali (mientras otros devolvian artículos robados que eran recuperados por la misma población)"
2378,"probablemente, las personas cuya forma de protestar es violenta, no tienen como objetivo carros particulares ni en general cosas que pueda afectar al pueblo, posiblemente sea alguien tratando de deslegitimizarlo"
2379,"Son los delincuentes Indígenas que llegaron desde el Departamento de El Cauca para delinquir en Cali,"
2380,"Si esto x100, piense op de que sirve tirarle rocas a un carro para la protesta ? La unica posibilidad que le diria oiga tal vez son protestantes es si sus padres manejan una Toyota blanca, porque digamos que representan a la 'gente de bien', pero si no, son seguramente infiltrados para deslegitimar la protesta"
2381,"Repuesta un poco irrelevante acá, pero posiblemente interesante: la navaja de Occam no es necesariamente una buena heurística. 

En vez de explicaciones sencillas, una alternativa es buscar explicaciones que son difíciles de variar (explanations that are hard to vary). Por ejemplo, parafraseando The beginning of infinity, una explicación que los griegos tenían para las estaciones era que cada año Perséfone tenía un tiempo en el cual podía salir del Hades, y que eso se expresaba en los cambios de temperatura. Esa explicación es sencilla si la comparamos con la explicación que las estaciones son debidas a la inclinación del eje de rotación de la tierra. Pero es una explicación fácil de variar: podemos cambiar Perséfone y Hades por Zeus y el Olimpo, o por la llegada del niño Dios en Diciembre. En cambio, en la explicación de la inclinación del eje de rotación, no podemos tan fácilmente cambiar el ángulo de inclinación, la velocidad de rotación de la tierra o demás parámetros: si cambiamos los parámetros, la explicación no se va a ajustar a las observaciones que hacemos sobre el clima en la tierra. Con las explicaciones difíciles de variar, lo que encontramos son explicaciones que dependen menos del contexto, y que permiten hacer predicciones más precisas.


Ahora volviendo al contexto de las protestas, posiblemente una mejor heurística a utilizar que la navaja de Occam, es la de buscar explicaciones difíciles de variar (no me pregunté cómo, yo solo estoy haciendo bien apunte irrelevante)"
2382,"Y por la respuesta que acaba de dar ya me doy cuenta la clase de realidad que quiere ver... Esa respuesta que en boca de un uribista es «excusas para zafarse de responsabilidad» pero en un «joven que reclama sus derechos» es una verdad incuestionable... Ponen el escenario para que pasen estas cosas y luego tienen la audacia de culpar a otros... Las manifestaciones y protestas SI tienen liderazgos, si no lo tienen es caos y vandalismo puro, dejen de excusarse por querer un espacio para soltar el mandril interno, están igualitos a los tombos abusivos justificando lo injustificable."
2383,"Te di un voto, aunque no estemos de acuerdo, porque estás aportando constructivamente a la discusión.

Te explico porqué no estamos de acuerdo.

Creo que has mal interpretado lo qué implica la navaja de Ockham.

> una mejor heurística a utilizar que la navaja de Occam, es la de buscar explicaciones difíciles de variar 

Estos dos principios no son contradictorios ni mucho menos mutuamente excluyentes. Es decir: una explicación simple no significa que puede estar sujeta a variaciones; tampoco significa que una explicación díficil de variar es necesariamente compleja.

El ejemplo de las estaciones y los dioses griegos, **NO** es un ejemplo de navaja de Ockham. Todo lo contrario. La explicación de cualquier fenómeno a traves de entidades ficticias NO son por ende simples. **No hay que confundir simples (falto de complejidad) con simplista (ingénuo), como es el caso de creer en dioses o explicaciones carentes de evidencia.**"
2384,"Me refería a que no tienen un líder o una cabeza impartiendo órdenes de marcha. Aunque tienen líderes no tienen una *cadena de mando*

Sí un joven decide tirar una piedra a un carro, no tiene nada de extraordinario."
2385,"Lo que quería mostrar con el ejemplo es que la navaja de Occam puede motivar a alguien a encontrar una explicación linguisticamente simple. El ejemplo de los dioses sólo se complejiza si comenzamos a agregar detalles sobre la naturaleza de los dioses en la explicación. La explicación con el ángulo de rotación tambien se puede complejizar una vez comenzamos a agregar detalles (por ejemplo, tratando de explicar porqué la tierra tiene ese eje de rotación).

La navaja de Occam nos dice que no deberíamos incluir dettalles irrelevantes, pero no dice cuando detenerse con los detalles. Decidir cuando un detalle es irrelevante queda a juicio propio (motivado por la dificultad computacional, o simplemente por estética).

Yo no quise dar a entender que la navaja de Occam y el principio de Deusthch de las explicaciones dificiles de variar fueran contradictorios o excluyentes. A lo que quería llegar es a que, con el principio de explicaciones dificiles de variar, el objetivo de la explicación es más claro y funcional: se busca una explicación que se pueda generalizar a nuevas observaciones y contextos, sin tener que ajustarla. En cambio, el objetivo de la navaja de Occam es la simplicidad en si misma."
2386,"Osea que el Comité del Paro, los lideres estudiantiles, los lideres comunitarios y los coordinadores de las marchas son teoría conspirativa o decoración... Eso que usted dice es una necedad, las marchas TODAS son organizadas, planeadas y coordinadas, no son hechas al azar ni producto de un egregor. La existencia de una cadena de mando NO IMPIDE que haya gente haciendo pendejadas sin órdenes, que el ser humano no es una hormiga ni un robot. Hasta entre fuerzas armadas pasan esas cosas, si un soldado quiere usar su arma LO VA A HACER y se enfrenta a las consecuencias haya o no recibido ordenes de hacerlo... Cuando la gente no entiende cómo funciona el poder y su relación con la Voluntad humana se cree esas excusas de cadenas de mando y organización premeditada de actos individuales.

Y antes que lo diga: La unica razón por la que un soldado que abre fuego sin orden es un crimen, y un marchante tira piedras sin una cadena de mando detrás es «normal», se debe a que a la marcha social en Colombia no la tieneb regulada Y NO LA QUIEREN REGULAR, precisamente porque tienen la loca idea que protestar es salir a quemar todo y que por arte de magia se solucione un problema (La misma lógica del abusador en una relación, cree que con golpear cosas se le va a arreglar la vida por arte de magia y la excusa «estoy emputado» lo exime de responsabilidad o carga moral) y porque, le voy a dar el dato, la marcha social en este país solo sirve para mantener los animos caldeados y que las élites puedan fidelizar sus rebaños electorales y afianzar la mentalidad de borrego en el pueblo... Un pueblo emputado NO PIENSA... Dos siglos y no notan el patrón???"
2387,"Eso no es una cadena de mando. 

Un cadena de mando es lo que tiene un ejército. Una persona da una orden y todos bajo su mando acatan.

Una protesta, un grupo de manifestantes, no tienen eso (La excepción es la minga. Pero la minga y los manifestantes no es lo mismo.)"
2388,"Entonces le reitero, usted lo que está diciendo es que tooooda esa gente que organiza el paro son unos pintados en la pared y que las protestas no tienen control... Y con ese argumento se quejan del ESMAD, que existe PRECISAMENTE para controlar turbas fuera de control? Basicamrnte acaba de decir que los marchantes son una banda de anarquistas sin ton ni son... Cuando la realidad es todo lo contrario... En el ejercito, por cierto, un general da una orden y esta se transmite a toda la cadena, los ejecutores tienen plena libertad de acción en tanto comsigan el objetivo, desde un «Capturen elemento X» hasta «Vuelen un oleoducto y luego embosquen a los que vengan a arreglarlo para capturar el objetivo» hay una diferencia propia de lo que usted dice que NO es una cadena de mando. Le repito, policías y soldados también pueden ir a hacer lo que les de la gana, no son robots ni hormigas y eso no anula la existencia de una cadena de mando. Igual que los marchantes. Todo es un tema de orden, ojo con esas concepciones, si el paro no tiene orden y es caos entonces es una amenaza para el bienestar de Colombia, basicamente justificando que los agreda la policía y la ciudadanía misma. Ojo pues, que yo se que esto no es lo que quiere decir, pero es lo que está diciendo sin darse cuenta."
2389,"Una protesta no tiene cadena de mando que cubra todos los manifestantes. 

No te lo puedo explicar más conciso que eso. Busca que significa cadena de mando si no me entiendes."

2402,"Pues mira:
primero en el comité del paro hay generalizando un poco exmiembros de guerrillas como las farc y personas que buscan instaurar un régimen comunista. (ejemplos de regímenes comunistas son Cuba y Venezuela)

Segundo el tema del robo es en parte culpa del propio colombiano que pide más subsidios que tienen que ser sacados de los impuestos de los colombianos, eso significa más impuestos es igual mayores recursos administrados por el estado lo que es igual a más corrupción. 

Tercero teniendo esto en cuenta el comité del paro no busca hacer mucho bien ya que entre todo lo que piden es más subsidios y sabemos que significa esto.

Solución posible
Podría ser eliminar la mayor cantidad de subsidios posibles para disminuir lo impuestos así dejar de poner tantos recursos en las manos del estado y con respecto al comité de paro disolver esto por que si lees sus aproximadamente 104 puntos ellos dicen que son trece pero son 104 son completamente inviables, además ellos son en parte los culpables de todo el vandalismo que llego con el paro por que por encima no pero en el fondo son igual de corruptos que nuestros políticos .

Por ultimo deberíamos no pedir comprensión y subsidios y menos impuestos, sino libertad las personas no recibirán más subsidios (que por cierto ellas mismas pagan con los impuestos ) sino que tendrán más dinero a su disposición ya que los impuestos bajan por que no habra subsidios que necesiten impuestos lo que también disminuye la corrupción por último reabrir el país porque está reforma es para pagar la deuda externa los subsidios y todo el dinero que se desperdició durante esta pandemia nunca debimos cerrar el país eso hizo más mal que bien.

Busquen liberarse económicamente del gobierno y recuerden no es una opción más impuestos a los ricos por que la mayoría son políticos y nadie se dispara en el pié."

2. Eso es corrupcion, por eso lo primero que hay que comenzar a cortar y cambiar es la hpta corrupcion, cut the fkn titties feeding the assholes, $30 million + extras a month is ridiculous, and getting pension for life after working 4 years is absurd, se entiende que reciba un bono por que le toca volver a conseguir trabajo si no es re-electo y solo deberian ser re-electos por un maximo de 1 periodo (8 años total), and that goes for fkn ex-presidents as well, set that to immediate action and retroactive, guess how much $$$ u have freed next month.

No basta solo con crear programas, se necesita un control muy fuerte sobre los gastos. Mientras la corrupción no se ponga bajo control en este país, cualquier programa del gobierno está condenado a funcionar a medias o a no funcionar en absoluto.

Pero tristemente estamos en el país que no quiso votar mayoritariamente por la consulta anti-corrupción, que no era perfecta, pero era un paso en la dirección correcta."
2432,"En primer lugar nisiquiera debería haber un ""comité de paro"" eso ya es de por sí burocrático. Hay mucha contradicción. No quieren una reforma que pretende recaudar unos 28 billones pero exigen peticiones que cuestan 83 billones."
2433,El comité de paro siempre listos para decepcionarnos y desaaprovechar oportunidades históricas
2434,"La pregunta es ""quienes son los del comite del paro"", alguien sabe quienes son estos?, la misma pregunta me hacia yo sobre estas ""propuestas"" que no solucionan el problema principal y por curiosidad me pregunte, y quien diablos es este Comite?, buscar en inet no da respuestas, so...no hay ningun medio que informe quienes son, ni siquiera los de las cadenas del regimen tienen esa info expuesta."
2435,"Muy inteligente su observación. Efectivamente, viniendo de uno de esos países 'ricos', la gente aqui no se da cuenta lo duro que uno tiene que trabajar en esos países, lo alto que son los impuestos, lo poco se puede hacer 'en negro' (por eso también solemos ser menos simpaticos también). Aqui en Colombia los impuestos también son altos, pero muy pocos los pagan. El otro día lei que la mitad de la población ni siquiera DECLARA renta, y que solo 4% (!!!!) de la poblacion efectivamente PAGA impuesto de renta. Si muestras esta cifra a un europeo, flipa. Obviamente la solución pasará por sueldos mas altos, pero para tener sueldos más altos, la productividad también tendrá que aumentar, es decir menos puestos de trabajo pero mejor pagados, pero con más presion de trabajo y menos 'libertad/flexibilidad'. Pero bueno, la situación como está ahora algun día tendra que cambiar."
2436,"El Comité del Paro son los mismos políticos, es decir, imaginen una revuelta de corderos contra lobos, pero los representantes de la revuelta son otros lobos ¿Entienden?"
2437,"Hay que entender que un pliego de peticiones no es un programa de gobiernos. De hecho, creo que el pliego es ingenuo por lo amplio que es. Ahí hay cosas en las que nos demoraríamos décadas, y que además tienen que ser escogidas por los colombianos en las urnas.

Y eso sin entrar a examinar la representatividad o legitimidad del famoso comité..."
2438,"Creo que debe girar en 3 ejes y los enumeró: 

Reducir la corrupcion, y hacer que la gobernabilidad sea más rápida.

Atender con ayudas sociales a las partes de la sociedad que lo necesitan ,pero el subsidio debe permitirles trabajar de hecho deberían para que el que lo reciba, debe tener actos que está luchando para salir de esa zona de riesgo.

Y el tercer punto reducir las excepciones tributarias que tienen muchas áreas industriales.

Pero se que estos temas con los gobernantes que existen (derecha, izquierda, centro) no van a ponerse de acuerdo, les pregunto es muy descabellada la idea de una Constituyente y así se reforman todos esos puntos directamente...

Saludos"
2439,"No sabía que el paro tenía un comité... 

Dónde se puede ver el pliego de peticiones?"
2440,De buenas a primeras me surgen tres preguntas: quienes conforman ese comité? Quien los eligió? Por qué no piden la renuncia del ministro de defensa?
2441,Y ¿qué propuestas tiene usted para combatir la corrupción? Eso no es tan fácil como decir que los servidores públicos firmen algún papel al posesionarse.
2442,Y cuál es el porcentaje de afiliacion sindical en Noruega y cuanto pagan los bancos? Pregunto por un amigo
2443,"Me parece hasta peor que la misma reforma tributaria hundida ese pliego. 

Los Colombianos tienen que pensar no solo en bajar impuestos, sino en quitar enlaces de codependencia con el estado. 

Eso claramente implica frenar programas sociales, y dejar esos asuntos descentralizados y realmente en manos del pueblo, sin formalismos, sin mordidas, sin chanchullo."
2444,¿Qué tiene de malo?
2445,Ese comité está conformado solo por tibios
2446,Me dolio tanto cuando se hundio esa consulta! Aqui se necesitan medidas anti-corrupcion urgentes.
2447,"La consulta fue ampliamente aprobada por la gran mayoría de los votantes.

Es mentira que no haya Sido la mayoría que dijo si. Fue las trabas que la misma corrupción le puso como el de exigir un número irrisoriamente alto considerando el histórico de votantes incluso en votaciones presidenciales. Suele a toda la propaganda politica que se le hizo a qué ""no hace falta"""

2450,"Con respecto a la declaracion de renta, quizas el mayor 'pero' es que se requiere pagar un contador, lo cual puede ser un costo considerable para una persona cuyo salario es de $2.500.000 mensuales. Pondre el ejemplo de Noruega otra vez, la declaracion de renta se hace a traves de un aplicativo web super facil de llenar, y no se requiere de intermediarios para nada. 

De hecho, en un sistema ideal, todos deberiamos declarar renta, con el fin de que el Gobierno tenga datos suficientes para saber quien debe pagar impuestos y quien debe recibir subsidios. Pero es esa corrupcion la que no nos deja progresar."
2451,"Es verdad. 

En Colombia la gente no quiere pagar impuestos, así deba hacerlo y tenga con qué. Yo trabajé haciendo ese recaudo y tuve que escuchar cada cosa, varias veces me quisieron ""untar la mano"" para desaparecer la cuentica... pedimos unos políticos y un gobierno menos corrupto y en nuestro día a día hacemos esto."
2452,Y lastimosamente…ese pliego no va a solucionar nada. Solo va a hacer más grande un Gobierno por el que se está protestando.

No entendi tu punto sobre los sindicatos. Un sindicato Noruego participa activamente de la politica, de hecho, tienen partidos politicos, y se reunen periodicamente con el Gobierno. Aqui los sindicatos solo se limitan a hacer marchas, pero no hay cambios de fondo. Cuantos referendums, plebiscitos han convocado los sindicatos en Colombia?

2516,"Quienes son los del ""comite""?, regla numero uno es un cambio en el sistema de pago de los corruptos electos empezando por el puerco!"
2517,Hombre... pero si se querían hacer matar por una reforma de 30 billones hahaha
2518,"Súper inviable, a no ser que nos pongan impuesto hasta por parpadear"
2519,"Puedo entenderlo si es para ""negociar"", pero lo peor es que no hay ninguna propuesta en contra de la corrupción o para disminuir el gasto publico, siendo la corrupción la problemática más importante en el país."
2520,No es eso lo que todos nos preguntamos en la vida? Quienes son los del comité del paro?
2521,Jaja ese golpe no lo vimos venir.
2522,"sí, pero van y le preguntan a la gente si quieren hacer algo contra la corrupción y [dicen que no](https://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias-america-latina-45317930)"
2523,"ROFL, I actually wonder cause donde estan los indigenas, si hay algo esto deberia ser televisado y la gente deberia ver quien diablos es quien diablos, por lo que me doy cuenta el ""comite"" esta compuesto por los mismos del gobierno o proxies, eso no es ""representacion"" de ninguno de los afectados que iniciaron el paro."
2524,"Total ! Pero como yo lo veo es que el problema de la corrupción y el  del referendo es el mismo. Los colombianos no estamos votamos a conciencia cuando toca. 

Comprar votos es barato porque hay pocos personas que están votando y se puede ganar fácil comprándolos. Qué pasaría si todos votáramos? Que sería inviable comprar tanto voto y comprometer tantos puestos gubernamentales. A los políticos les tocaría convencer a la gente a punta de buenas propuestas. 

Colombia tiene una gran oportunidad cada 4 años de cambiar las cosas y debemos reconocer que el poder no está en la violencia sino en una pinche papeleta."
2525,"nah, man ni me hagas acordar, ese día entendí que el problema de Colombia va más allá de los políticos."
2526,"Eso no soluciona nada, en Sudamerica solo Chile y Colombia el voto no es obligatorio, los demás países tienen hasta sanciones económicas por no votar y no es que les vaya mejor en temas de corrupción."
2527,"No estoy hablando de poner una multa por no votar. Se ha demostrado que en los países que es obligatorio votar hay personas después de 20 días ya ni se acuerdan del candidato por el que votaron.

Lo que digo es que se debe hacer un voto a conciencia en los momentos adecuados. Hablando desde el contexto del referendo y debido a que seguimos eligiendo a los mismos corruptos de siempre."

En Bogotá el centro de distribución de Servientrega queda afuera de la ciudad por la calle 80, usualmente lo que hacen las empresas de envio es recojer los paquetes en las oficinas, llevar a centros de distribución/sorteo y redistribuir al destino en otro vehiculo. No me consta pero es razonable asumir que la mensajería por compañías de paquetes debe estar retrazada."
2534,"Por lo que entiendo un proceso de revocatoria ahorita no asegura que los próximos presidentes, congresistas y senadores sean nuevamente corruptos. Lo único que se me ocurre que puede ayudar es que cada persona de un voto responsable y consiente por un candidato que en verdad los represente en cada una de las próximas votaciones. Así comprar votos se vuelve algo sumamente difícil de hacer porque les saldría muy caro y además los políticos asumirían el puesto comprometidos con propuestas a la gente que le dio el voto (más no gracias a mermelada ya que no alcanzaría a ser viable si todos votáramos)."
2535,Quien quedaria si duque sale? No entiendo mucho de politica.
2536,"Ese es un proceso que está previsto en la constitución, pero en la práctica nunca funciona, cuántas veces hemos escuchado de una recolección de firmas para revocar un alcalde y nunca ha sido posible, siempre existe un pero."
2537,"Pero tarde que temprano tendremos elecciones (a menos de que se termine instaurando la dictadura…uno nunca sabe). Y pues he escuchado que en las marchas ya están pidiendo la renuncia de Duque. Entonces, en el caso de que este man renuncie, durante ese proceso de transición quedaríamos a Merced del ejercito o del presidente del senado (el Char)."

Uno ha ostentado el poder por lo menos por 8 años, y el otro apenas viene agarrando tracción como una figura antagónica (irónicamente, producto de los mismos partidarios de Uribe. De otro modo, se hubiese quedado con el mismo perfil con el que tienen a Cepeda).

Más allá de la cuestionable alcaldía que tuvo, su pasado en el M-19 y su video de las bolsas, la influencia de Petro aún palidece frente a la de Uribe. Sin mencionar que la dimensión de sus escándalos políticos es completamente desigual.

Considero que igualarlos es trivializar una coyuntura política mucho más compleja y que tiene diferentes aristas, y no solo dos polos y un centro (prácticamente la narración maniqueista que sustenta al uribismo en vacas flacas)."
2556,"por qué? ósea no es como si uno tuviera una gigantesca responsabilidad en la situación actual del pais, la corrupción, falsos positivos, que el pais este en manos de los grandes empresarios fanáticos del monopolio, el bipartidismo y la satanización de la izquierda política o cualquiera que piense diferente a el

mientras que el otro es un progresista, que no es corrupto, que no miente y que la única razón de por que les cae mal es por que el uribismo supo como manchar su reputación, porque no, Petro y Uribe son completamente diferentes, no solo en política"

2560,"Frente a la responsabiliad histórica, sin duda estoy con usted. Hay algunas cosas que quedaron pendientes (o cuanto menos sin mencionar) de la administración de Petro en Bogotá (las cuales, sin duda alguna, no se comparan con lo que realizó Uribe). 

Frente a la forma de realizar polítca, y a su forma de administrar, difiero profundamente con usted."
2561,"Petro no sataniza al que piensa diferente a él? wuau primera vez que lo escucho. Según él mismo, se atribuye la creación de algo asi como dos mil quinientos nuevos empleos en Bogotá, claro lo que no dice es incrementó la burocracia y las corbatas, así hasta yo genero 2.500 empleos nuevos (no sostenibles).

 En cuánto al progresismo, el mas famoso de Latinoamérica ha sido Chávez dicho también por el mismo comandante en una de tantas entrevistas en 1998 semanas antes de su elección y luego ratificado por Petro en 2002 (también disponible en YouTube por si acaso) entonces pues ser progresista no es sinónimo de maravilla o que sea el ""cambio"".     

 Colombia no necesita mas Mesías y tristemente el señor Petro se ve así mismo como tal (fuentes disponibles, si las necesitas las busco y te las paso) y decir algo ligeramente negativo de él o mostrarse en desacuerdo con él es ganarse la enemistad de sus huestes. (véase como se expresa Levy Rincón de Daniel Coronel por no ser petrista y no desgastarse en ese debate).

 Adicionalmente Petro no le tiembla la lengua para mentir con relación a sus cifras, véase en su Twitter cuando el mismo se echa flores diciendo que bajo la pobreza dimensional de Bogotá durante su gestión, claro omitió decir que fruto de las regalías de la nación en la década dorada de las materias primas todo el país la bajó? Que es real en lo que el dice? Entonces, cuando la gente dice que Uribe y Petro son lo mismo es porque sienten que son mas  los rasgos que los acercan que los que los alejan, cuál entonces es el motivo para desconocer el sentir de muchos? O más bien por que lo creen o no le creen? O te parece que cuándo el se llena la boca diciendo, YO saqué 8 millones de votos será que el man no dice, coño votaron por mí porque no querían votar por Porky? No, no lo piensa... el man está convencido que el los sacó porque viene de una costilla de Jesus,  bueno eso último no tengo respaldo me dejé llevar.
 Finalmente por que HDP tenemos que votar por X para que no quede Y? Por que HDP nos perdemos de gente buena por eso? Porque  la  gente tiene que votar con miedo o con rabia? O tu crees que el innombrable llegó por qué? Porque la gente tenía rabia estaba podrida de la guerrilla. Las condiciones son similares solo que para el otro lado con un personaje con los mismos rasgos del otro pero de izquierda. Entonces? Para dónde vamos?"
2562,"el peor error que podemos hacer es creer que porque son disidentes son mejores, este gobierno es una mierda y si gobierna la izquierda lo va a hacer igual, este gobierno te mete una reforma tributaria en medio de pandemia como unos hijos de puta y un gobierno de izquierdas tambien te va a subir los impuestos pero con palabras mas bonitas como por ejemplo ""justicia social"" ""renta basica universal"" o ""estado de bienestar"" igual te quieren clavar e igual te quieren robar, misma mierda solo que uno llegó al poder y el otro no"

Mire, creo que me exprese mal en varios sentidos, a ver, me dije que no mentía refiriéndome a como lo hace uribe y en general los uribistas, no que inflaba números y se atribuía cosas que el no hizo o que no necesariamente fueron por el, me salte la parte de la comparación jaja
Ahora, hablar de Chávez como progresista... Hasta donde yo se era más socialista pero bueno , en cualquier caso, el man fue un dictador que no supo manejar a Venezuela y jodio en todo lo que se podía joder y hasta más, pero no mms, chavez y Petro son polos opuestos dentro de la izquierda por favor
Por último, quiero agregar que si bien apoyo a Petro sobre los candidatos actuales, obviamente estoy en contra de muchas de sus ideas, pero con los hptas uribistas corruptos y asesinos y con los de centro hipócritas y muchos corruptos, pues Petro es la mejor opcion"

2641,"Se lo voy a decir de la manera mas cruda posible:

1.- No hay un objetivo definido en esas protestas. Sacar a duque?, nuevas elecciones?, eliminar el congreso?.

2.- Al no haber objetivo y afectar directamente el aparato productivo (que nada tiene que ver con el sector político) la gente comienza a cansarse.

3.- Los vandalos que son menos del 5% de los protestantes (puede haber hasta infiltrados), terminan por desacreditar las protestas.

4.- Los politicos de izquierda que buscan pescar en rio revuelto y que no les interesa el pueblo colombiano, pero reciben financiamiento de paises que odian a Duque (por ejemplo Venezuela), continuan en redes sociales aupando la protesta (nuevamente sin un objetivo definido), solo para mostrar poder ante los conservadores y negociar por debajo de la mesa con ellos (sigue estando fuera el pueblo de todo esto).

Por todo esto no veo las protestas por buen camino, pienso mejor que de este proceso debe nacer un lider diferente que aglutine a todos los afectados y que logre hacer un peso suficiente para que a través del voto puedan cambiar el destino del pais."
2642,"Quizás el diálogo y la vida estén garantizados en una democracia saludable y plena... pero la nuestra está enferma y es débil. Es suficientemente ver el mal direccionamiento de la policía la cual de forma con doctrina militar y no como un cuerpo cívico garante de derechos humanos humanos, a esto súmele que es un organismo muy susceptible a la corrupción y no tienen evaluaciones psicológicas rígidas ni formación apropiada en DIH.

Usted puede inferir la poca disposición al diálogo de un gobierno cuando comienza con el discurso del enemigo interno y actúa de forma ineficiente para que la propia llama de la protesta se ahogue por extenderse tanto tiempo"
2643,"> ¿No están la vida y el diálogo garantizados en una democracia?

De hecho, hubo un diálogo entre los líderes de la protesta y el gobierno. Pero no es suficiente que la gente no sea feliz hasta que haya un cambio de gobierno.

Colombia es un país violento en 2020 hubo 12018 asesinatos. Lo que significa que en promedio 33 personas son asesinadas todos los días. El 40% de la población vive en la pobreza y solo el 25% más rico del país es lo que podemos considerar de clase media. La mayoría son pobres

La violencia no se detiene solo porque el gobierno cambia de posición. Continúa hasta que se resuelven los problemas ecenomico de la sociedad."
2644,¿Las 13 muertes en Cali ese día de ayer fueron por la policía? ¿Usted considera que está informado sobre lo que pasó?

Solo se puede negociar con Uribe, pero a él nada le afecta, en el 2022 pondrá otro de sus títeres y ya."
2648,"Eso de que no hay objetivos no es cierto, y muestra lo mucho que se ha informado solo por medios tradicionales. Los jóvenes si se han organizado en sus pueblos y localidades sacando peticiones muy concretas, por ejemplo la reforma a la policía, que una reforma tributaria se contruya en diálogo con otros sectores, una renta basica... Entre muchas más. La cosa es que Duque se siente dialogar con ellos y deje de dispararles.


Y no venga a decirme que el comité de paro dijo o pidió esto y lo otro, ese comité no representa a nadie.


Y no, Petro o maduro no controlan las protestas."

Si no le gusta que los pobres tomen sus contenedores como rehenes.  Entonces espero que en las próximas elecciones voten por alguien que aumente sus impuestos para mantener a los pobres, para que puedan comer, para que puedan obtener una educación y comprender cómo funcionan realmente los mercados.  Entonces no tomarán sus contenedores como rehenes y entenderán que al hacerlo se están haciendo más daño a sí mismos que a usted.

Desacreditan la protesta de la manera en que se cambia el foco de discusión al accionar de esos reducidos grupos, apoyándose más la idea en sectores contrarios de usar la fuerza porque ""vandalizaran y robaran nuestros negocios"" o similares. Dejando que esos mismos grupos y el gobierno ""legitimen"" sus crímenes mientras que las protestas pacíficas y sus líneas de defensa e información (Primera Línea, ONG's, periodistas, médicos etc) son los que pagan el pato.

Además de que esas no-pacificas revoluciones o revueltas a las que te refieres son más parecidas a lo que ha hecho las FARC, el ELN, el M-19 etc en este país (no los aplaudo ni los apoyo) que un grupo de gente quemando un banco o un autobus mientras que la primera línea está siendo pisoteada. Debido a que esas revoluciones han sido hijueputas guerras civiles jodidamente sangrientas y bien armadas. No un grupo de gente que quema un edificio o medio asaltan una tienda (se roban solo los televisores, sera que se los irán a comer o vender) y se escudan entre la población civil. Que si los críticas, te dicen que están tirando la tiranía rompiendo uno que otro vidrio o que ""nada se ha hecho con protestas pacíficas"",  pero si les propones que la población civil tenga armas para su defensa o cosas así, es que se necesita un país en paz o ""nada se resuelve con violencia""."

Traducción (a ver si queda más claro): efectivamente el Estado está capturando, torturando y matando y despareciendo forzosamente.

La ONG Temblores dice que estas desapariciones se adjudican al Estado porque las personas reportan a sus familiares que la policía se los están llevando a un sitio X y cuando los familiares van a preguntar al sitio X no les dan razón de dónde están sus desaparecidos, de manera que así se determina (se filtra por así decirlo) que no son desapariciones independientes del Paro. No hay que esperar ningún tiempo para reportar desaparecidos (a veces dicen que toca esperar 72 horas pero eso es falso), se reporta a alguien como desaparecido en el momento que no se tiene conocimiento de su paradero a pesar de que la policía les dice que están en un lugar en el que realmente no están."

¿De qué está hablando? Con esa frase estaba haciendo referencia a las peticiones del Comité del paro, ninguna de las cuales tiene que ver con reabrir la frontera.

La segunda frase que cita hace parte de otro párrafo y de otra discusión, y además también la sacó de contexto y no hace referencia al cierre de la frontera, sino al hecho de que usted dijo que había que desarrollar el comercio con Venezuela y hacer regresar a los venezolanos a su país (con lo cual se contradice con respecto a lo de reabrir la frontera). Yo sí creo que la frontera debe estar abierta, Duque la cerró por la pandemia, Maduro la ha hecho cerrar varias veces. Pero dinamizar el comercio con Venezuela depende de que exista una economía en Venezuela, y esta cada vez se contrae más y más.

En ese mismo hilo hizo lo mismo, sacando de contexto y tergiversando varias cosas que dije. Le respondí de vuelta, lo refuté, y no respondió más.

>Ahora resulta ser que el gobierno anunció que va a abrir las fronteras con Venezuela aplicando normas de bioseguridad. O sea, mágicamente después del paro desaparecieron todos los riesgos por COVID que mantuvieron dichas fronteras cerradas por más de un año

O de pronto ahora el Gobierno tiene una capacidad de hacer testeos mucho mayor que la que tenía hace un año, por ejemplo? Además de haber negociado y asegurado más de 70 millones de vacunas.  
  


>La realidad es que el gobierno empieza a mostrar su desespero porque sabe que tiene que reactivar la economía a como dé lugar y especialmente en Cúcuta,

O de pronto ese es el trabajo del gobierno? Intentar dinamizar y reactivar la economía, y buscar un equilibrio entre actividad económica y salud.

>la situación del gobierno es particularmente débil porque se quedó sin las cartas de acusar al gobierno venezolano de reprimir la protesta pacífica.

¿? Lo siento, Chávez, pero no. Los abusos de DDHH en Venezuela no dejan de existir en razón de lo que suceda en Colombia. Igual Colombia está en la OEA y en otros organismos, y eso la obliga a tomar parte en las denuncias y medidas contra esos abusos, de la misma forma que tiene que responder por los abusos aquí.

Lo que cita de Maduro no demuestra que tenga ninguna sartén por el mango, demuestra que Venezuela también cerró su frontera, contrario a lo que usted decía.

Mirando en su historial de posts también miré por encima y descubrí otras estupideces que dijo en otras discusiones, como que ""la reforma tributaria se aprueba al todo o nada"" (completamente falso)."
2699,"Esté abierta o cerrada la frontera con Venezuela, es lo mismo. Aunque cerrada es más peligroso en general, te lo dice alguien que ha vivido toda su vida ahí."
2700,"Se le olvida que ahorita en la frontera está una de nose cuantas disidencias de las FARC dándose palo con el ejército venezolano al tal punto que casi toda la gente de un pueblo venezolano se tuvo que venir aca, no lose Rick, eso no da ganas de abrir la frontera"
2701,"Hola. No entiendo por qué la molestia, si incluso tuve la gentileza de hacer una mención a u usuario para que estuvieras al tanto de lo que publiqué. 

En realidad no tengo ganas de discutir contigo. Creo que tenemos distintas interpretaciones de la discusión y, sin ánimo de ofender, no creo que estés discutiendo de buena fe. Yo literalmente inicié mi argumento con la siguiente frase:

>... debería Duque, por ejemplo, dejar de pendejear con lo de Maduro y los derechos humanos y abrir la frontera para que se dinamice el comercio con Venezuela... Nada más por ahí tienes cientos de millones de dólares para empezar a cerrar la brecha fiscal. 

Luego mencioné un conjunto de acciones que **yo** considero pudieran ayudar a recaudar fondos distintas a las que aparecían en la reforma tributaria original incluyendo - y esta es una idea enteramente propia, basada en evidencia y que mal pudiera yo endilgársela al Comité del Paro - de legalizar el cannabis e imponer fuertes tributos a su consumo y comercialización. 

Culminé la lista señalando que:

>El Estado tiene herramientas a su disposición para hacer frente a la crisis. 

**Unas herramientas que claramente partieron de mí - /u/Beginning_Beginning - no del Comité del Paro**. ¿Qué carajos iba a saber yo (o cualquiera de nosotros si a ver vamos) cuáles eran esas propuestas en ese momento? Y sin embargo tú empezaste a responder cada uno de **mis** puntos: ""impuesto a las bebidas azucaradas, puede ser, puede que no...""; ""medidas y proyectos en curso para reducir los gastos de funcionamiento del Estado ya hay varias...""; ""lo de impulsar el comercio con Venezuela no tiene sentido..."", y culminaste escribiendo que ""en general no hay razón para que el Gobierno 'conceda' así como así ninguno de esos puntos. Son cosas que requerirían muchísimo más debate y deliberación"".

Seamos serios por favor. ¿Ahora resulta ser tú estabas era respondiendo los puntos del Comité del Paro? ¿De dónde salió eso y cómo alguien podría saberlo?

Tú expusiste las razones por las cuáles lo de impulsar el comercio con Venezuela no tenía sentido, yo expliqué por qué tu razonamiento era errado y tú contra-argumentaste señalando razones adicionales. Es todo parte del mismo hilo de discusión. Estoy al tanto de la frase ""Obvio que yo creo que debe estar abierta"" pero ello no concuerda con la idea de que ""impulsar el comercio con Venezuela no tiene sentido"" cuando yo enlacé no una sino cuatro fuentes de empresarios colombianos solicitando apoyo al ejecutivo a lo largo de un año para que se abriera la frontera y así impulsar el comercio con Venezuela. Ya ahí no había más que responder, tú hiciste un comentario basado en suposiciones personales que no se sostienen a la luz de los hechos (y a la final tuve yo la razón, Duque abrió la frontera). 

Con respecto a lo demás no voy a comentar. Guarda esta conversación y revísala periódicamente cuando veas lo que va a pasar con Guaidó, con las elecciones de alcaldes y gobernadores en Venezuela, con la bajada de tono de las acusaciones de Colombia hacia Venezuela y el cambio de actitud del grupo de Chile, con la mejora del comercio binacional luego de que el gobierno colombiano se vea obligado a negociar de tú a tú con Maduro y se le olvide el gobierno interino y toda el cuento de los derechos humanos (que Colombia también se pasa por el forro).

A la final a los hechos no les importan los comentarios formulados en Reddit por un par de desconocidos."
2702,"Lo ideal dicta que un gobierno debería tomar las mejores decisiones para garantizar el bienestar de los pobladores. 

Una visión más pragmática (más cínica, aunque más ajustada a nuestras realidades) es que un gobierno debería tomar las mejores decisiones que le permitan mantenerse en el poder, lo cual uno esperaría que implique garantizar el bienestar de los pobladores para que estos los vuelvan a votar en las siguientes elecciones.  

La gente que ha leído este post y le ha hecho downvotes quizás no se ha dado cuenta de que, la ineptitud de Duque es porque no ha sabido tomar decisiones adecuadas, por ejemplo en materia de COVID (el bienestar de las personas), pero aún si no le importase el bienestar de las personas, más importante aún es que no ha tomado las decisiones adecuadas que debería haber tomado si quiere mantenerse en el poder. 

Puede que estando la frontera abierta o cerrada con Venezuela sea lo mismo, pero la percepción de la gente vale muchísimo y hay cosas que son indudables: uno, que Cúcuta está vuelta mierda y el cierre de frontera le dio durísmo; dos, que la gente de Cúcuta lleva un año rogándole a Duque porque abra la frontera; tres, que el Norte de Santander es crucial en el plan electoral del Centro Democrático para las elecciones del 2022; cuatro, que el gobierno así lo reconoce y - a pesar de haber dicho lo contrario hace apenas un mes cuando Duque ""definitivamente descartó esta posibilidad"" - le tocó volver a abrir la frontera; cinco, que lo hace desde una posición débil, con una imagen internacional seriamente opacada, pero negándose a negociar con Venezuela y apoyando a un gobierno paralelo venezolano que la Unión Europea dejó de reconocer en enero. 

De paso, está contra el tiempo en bajar las tensiones y reactivar la economía porque aún no ha acabado el paro y mientras tanto está tratando de mejorar la imagen del país y sacar una nueva reforma tributaria que tiene que pasar sí o sí y pronto, porque si no Fitch y Moody's también van a calificar la deuda colombiana como BBB- lo cual sería fatal. Para rematar, estamos en medio de un tercer pico de pandemia que está matando a 500 colombianos todos los días y que de repente obliga otra vez a cerrar los pasos por concepto de cuarentena (con todo y que ya ni nos acordemos). 

Esa es la realidad, yo no entiendo qué es tan difícil de aceptar. Como le dije al otro usuario: guarde este post y veremos cuál va a ser la actitud del gobierno de Duque frente al de Maduro en los meses por venir, vamos a ver cómo evoluciona el conflicto venezolano este año electoral, vamos a ver cómo Guaidó sale como corcho de limonada."
2703,"Lo que a ti y mí nos dé ganas es irrelevante.

Ellos son quienes deberían rendir cuentas."
2732,">al menos 41 muertos por las balas de la policía

falso, de esos 41 muertos no todos fueron por balas de la policía. de hecho, dos son policías. Otros fueron asesinato de civiles contra civiles, también hubo una muerte por paro cardiaco, otra por accidente."
2733,"No son los únicos lanzando explosivos...que pena pero eso es de parte y parte. He estado en varias y he visto tanto abuso policial como victimización por parte de los manifestantes...todos los que no son de aquí deberían ver la historia completa. Deberían ver como se meten a robar a los súper mercados, como atacan a gente que no tiene nada que ver y como cobran para poder pasar por las vías...eso también es parte de la protesta y los únicos bastardos animales no son los de la policía..."

2735,"Ojala existiera algun medio que contara las cosas como son pero todos son biased con las cosas.

Estudie en una Universidad Privada-Publica y vi lo peor de ambos bandos con los profesores. El Conservador Catolico Megauribista y el Commie que Glamorizaba Cuba-El Marxismo.

Yo personalmente creo que el paro fue justo y funciono pero es inhumano no preocuparse victimas de ambos lados y por todas las familias que se fueron a la calle-perdieron todo por esto......tambien si trae crisis economica al pais peor que las reformas entonces cual es el punto???? remedio peor que la enfermedad? aqui ambos lados se estan haciendo los sordos y pueden arruinarnos a todos si siguen con esto. Que busquen soluciones rapido y ya. Duque en que piensa porque tan lento????? A este paso lo que ocurrira es una Guerra Civil o algo porque las personas ya estan cansadas.

Aqui existe una mezcla de cosas. Causas muy justas porque el gobierno tiene muy descuidado todo-Interes politicos de ambos extremos-Covid....un desastre total. No me gusta Santos nada pero al menos en su mandato hubo mas tranquilidad. Bring me back to 2016 hahaha when life was good ⭐

2738,"Bueno eso si es cierto en este sub. Falta mucha objetividad aqui y si lo mencionas te tachan de ""tibio"" los violentos. A mi me parece eso terrible. Cuando se habla de los muertos pero se ignora que tambien muchos policias murieron como el que le pegaron las puñaladas que se ve no era mala persona. Yo soy de izquierda pero algunas persona de mi bando a veces me dan miedo."
2739,Totalmente de acuerdo. Todo esto se da por la falta de educacion tan severa que tenemos en Colombia.
2740,"Además de la falta de educación, tampoco sabemos cómo se maneja el país, desconocemos las leyes y la estructura del Estado, así hayamos pasado por la universidad. De esto se valen los políticos y los medios para manipularnos a su antojo."
2741,"Hmmm....cuerto, la policia esta haciendo bastantes cosas incorrectas, yo tambien vi el video donde salen con tv nuevecito, y otras cosas, tambien el del exito donde metieron un poco de gente y a unos los golpearon y a otros los ayudaron a salir...cierto, falta mostrar la historia completa, por cierto, hay que recordar quienes son los que usan gases y flashbangs!"

2743,También la historia del país y por qué los colombianos siempre han estado peleando entre sí.
2744,"Pero dígame cómo controla uno a un montón de gente que aunque la mayoría está ejerciendo su derecho constitucional a la protesta, hay otros mal intencionados intentando hacer maldades? Pareciera que lo único que les sirve es que los policías les den las pistolas...realmente me parece muy triste que se aprovechen de un reclamo legítimo para hacer lo que les da la gana con los bienes de los demás, olvidamos que si bien la corrupción cuesta mucho al país, esto no ayuda en nada...se quejan por muchos afectados, pero están queriendo hacer pasar a la gente que ha luchado toda la vida para tener un negocio como pérdidas colaterales. Honestamente no es justo con el resto de gente, yo apoyo la movilización, personalmente he ido a varias...pero hasta aquí, he visto como los mismos manifestantes provocan a la policía, he visto que les tiran explosivos improvisados y he visto en primera plana el amarillismo más triste, ofensivo y denigrante. Le recuerdo que el fin no justifica los medios y si así están actuando por una causa,  por justa que sea, su forma de ser entonces no dista mucho del pensamiento del señor Uribe...hay que saber hacer las cosas y honestamente estamos actuando con dolo y estamos culpando al estado por ello...eso es caer muy bajo y personalmente yo me bajo de ese tren"
2745,"Exacto, también eso."
2746,"Voy a hacer algunas reflexiones que no denotan apoyo o rechazo a cierto tipo de protesta sino que busca explicar el por qué el pacifismo da paso a la violencia. Si entendemos las causas reales, eventualmente pudiéramos dar con respuestas efectivas. 

I. Para llegar a tu pregunta deberíamos cuestionarnos primero ¿para qué sirve la protesta? y más concretamente ¿para qué sirve la protesta pacífica y más en un país como Colombia? 

A mí me llama muchísimo la atención cuando la gente, como tú, dice que las personas tienen derecho a protestar de manera individual o colectiva sin afectar a los demás. Pero, honestamente ¿para qué sirve eso en un país como Colombia? ¿En un país donde se pierden 50 billones de pesos al año por concepto de corrupción, irrespetando todos los derechos habidos y por haber (el de la movilización por vías dañadas y puentes caidos, el de la salud y la educación por falta de recursos, etc.) qué va a importar el derecho a la protesta? ¿Un país en dónde el Fiscal General Barbosa acaba de retirar a la fiscal Amparo Ceron, quien llevaba 3 años investigando el caso Odebretch, un día después de que pidiera una reunión con la vicefiscal para informar que iba a llamar a indagatoria a Álvaro Uribe, a Andrés Pastrana y a Luis Carlos Sarmiento Angulo? 

""¡Ay! Apoyemos el derecho de esos ciudadanos a que pierdan su tiempo protestando frente a la Fiscalía General de la Nación de forma pacífica, una protesta que nadie va a ver porque de paso los medios de comunicación se van a limpiar el culo con ella y la van a ignorar por completo"".  

Entonces, acá apoyar la protesta pacífica es básicamente apoyar nada. Yo no digo que haya que apoyar la protesta violenta, pero pudiera uno ser más honesto y eliminar el derecho a la protesta pacífica y ya: nos ahorramos tiempo, esfuerzo y sueños vanos. Porque, además, el gobierno ha demostrado que, aún cuando acepte negociar con los protestantes pacíficos y llegue a acuerdos, estos acuerdos no va a tener intención de cumplirlos, como pasó con los acuerdos a los que se llegaron luego de las protestas de 2019. 


II. Hay una cosa de la que probablemente no estés al tanto, pero distintas estrategias de protesta como mecanismo para lograr cambios políticos y sociales son estudiadas e implementadas a lo largo del mundo y se verifica su efectividad permanentemente. Hace un poco menos de dos décadas comenzaron a suscitarse entre varias de las ex-repúblicas soviéticas un conjunto de movimientos insurgentes más o menos pacíficos (pero todos enarbolando la bandera de la no-violencia) que recibieron en su conjunto el nombre de Revoluciones de Colores. Esas revoluciones estuvieron fuertemente influenciadas por la obra de un tipo de nombre Gene Sharp. En todas estas revoluciones hubo la participación y financiación más o menos directa de organizaciones como USAID, NED, Freedom House, Soros Foundation, IRI, Albert Einstein Institution entre otros. 

Al principio las Revoluciones de Colores tuvieron éxito: en Georgia, Ukrania, Kirguistán, Líbano; pero luego empezaron a fracasar: Armenia, Azerbaiján, Moldavia, Uzbekistán, Bielorrusia, etc. Los gobiernos empezaron a idear formas para contrarrestar estos llamados ""golpes suaves"", en todos los casos con fuertes medidas represivas (viene a la mente Irán) pero en algunos casos a punta de plomo (como pasó en Bahrein). Es desafortunado, pero la protesta pacífica se devaluó aún más cuando se enarboló como mecanismo de cambio político, abrazando las demandas genuinas de la gente pero impulsado por motivos geopolíticos más amplios. 

Después de esto las siguientes revoluciones que vinieron todas han involucrado la fuerza de las armas y la violencia en conjunto con la protesta social: Siria, Irak, ~~Líbano~~ Libia (de hecho, todas las revoluciones de la llamada ""Primavera Árabe""). Acá en Latinoamérica tenemos lo que pasó en Honduras y en Bolivia, dos golpes de Estado que se consumaron sólo porque las fuerzas de seguridad del estado terminaron participando de forma activa en los derrocamientos. 

Entonces, el segundo punto es que, en los actuales momentos, lo que nos enseña la historia contemporánea es que la protesta pacífica se ha venido devaluando y que, por el contrario, la violencia genera mayores réditos. 


III. Lo tercero es que la historia también nos indica que los problemas económicos de la nación debilitan al gobierno, puede que la gente se canse ahorita de los protestantes pero la gente tiene una memoria histórica cortísima y a la final, en unos meses cuando todos los problemas de la contracción económica, la pandemia, etc. la gente va a culpar a Duque de su situación. Es famosa la frase de Richard Nixon a propósito de la situación económica en Chile durante el gobierno de Allende: ""Make the economy scream"" - o sea, que grite la economía. ¿Tú crees que la gente pensaba en Nixon y la CIA cuando subía la inflación a cifras de tres dígitos y la escasez producto de la especulación y el acaparamiento? Pensaban en Allende y su incapacidad por poner orden en el país (más allá de que le resultara imposible). Es precisamente por este motivo que lo primero que hace los EEUU cuando quiere sacudir un gobierno incómodo es poner sanciones económicas que lo debiliten y la gente se obstine, llámese Irán o Cuba o Venezuela. 

El punto es que la protesta que incomoda económicamente tiene más posibilidades de éxito que la que no. 

---

Mi posición es que no debería haber bloqueos ni violencia si existiesen formas correctas y respuestas adecuadas a las demandas de la población. A mí también me afectan los bloqueos y todo lo que ello implica así que mal pudiera yo estar de acuerdo. Sin embargo, entiendo la lógica detrás del por qué algunos civiles terminan cerrando vias y haciendo desmadres. Creo que es el Estado el que tiene la responsabilidad de hallar formas de tender puentes entre los distintos sectores de la sociedad para evitar llegar a estos extremos.

EDIT - Cosa que el Estado no sólo no está haciendo sino lo contrario, busca deslegitimar la propuesta minimizando la manifestación pacífica (masiva) y enfocándose en el bandidaje a la vez que los organismos de seguridad del Estado apelan sistemáticamente a la provocación con el fin de generar más violencia."
2747,"Me atrevo a decir que la gran mayoría de personas que apoyamos las protestas no está a favor de los bloqueos, ni son los que van a realizar actos vandálicos o bloqueos y demás. Estos son una fuerte minoría, con uno que otro policia infiltrado de por medio. La cuestión es que, estas personas también apoyan el paro, entonces todos creamos un estigma interno (ayudado por los medios de *des*información) de como las protestas no son este espacio de indignación, discusión, diversidad cultural y demás, sino que está predominantemente influenciado por los actos vandálicos, teniendo como resultado que la creencia de muchos que salir a protestar es apoyar dichos actos, y para algunos círculos más extremistas, incluso es sinónimo de ser vándalo o terrorista (!).

Yo personalmente lo apoyo, pero me entristece ver cosas como las historias de las personas que se han precarizado sus condiciones laborales, cuando queman un negocio pequeño, cuando asesinan a un policia, etc, pero aún más tristeza y rabia me genera ver a un  Estado garantizador de derechos quitar ojos e incluso asesinar a civiles, historias de personas que no pueden  acceder a un hospital, a sus pensiones, a una educación, o como se roban billones al año en corrupción (no apoyo los actos vandálicos, pero veo pertinente aclarar que este valor supera en varios ordenes de magnitud los gastos por reparación a la propiedad pública)."
2748,"Nadie apoya el vandalismo, pero es que solo a Duque se le ocurre meter más impuestos en plena pandemia y persuadir a la fuerza pública a usar la fuerza en contra de los ciudadanos.

Si los indígenas se sintieran escuchados no requerirían vías de hecho para salir en las noticias. Si ellos taponan las vías es porque el gobierno les hizo promesas de campaña y luego ni los vuelve a mirar. Los canales oficiales ya los agotaron hace rato.

Al gobierno simplemente no le da la gana mandar al presidente o a un ministro a negociar con el movimiento (no con la ""oposición"" de tibios que se inventaron), los delfines no se mezclan con la plebe.

Con dos visitas, con dar garantías así fuera a medias, se terminaban los bloqueos. Pero no les da la puta gana."
2749,"Creo que con los bloqueos y el vandalismo, los promotores del paro están empeorando las cosas.

Si van a presionar al gobierno, háganlo con inteligencia. Si van a hacer bloqueos, háganlos en edificios del gobierno, sedes de grandes compañías, sedes de partidos políticos, sedes de grandes medios de comunicación y casas de los ricos y los políticos.

La gracia es que se incomode a las élites políticas y económicas, **no a la ciudadanía del común**."
2750,"Yo siento que los Bloqueos en las carreteras desesperaron a la people y eso le quito poder a la Marcha. Aqui en mi barrio apoyaban eso y cuando vieron que ya no habia comida ahi se fueron contra los que marchan.  Se habria sostenido mas esto si hubiera sido solo en las ciudades. No estoy de acuerdo cuando las marchas se concentran en un solo lugar de la ciudad porque afectan a los negocios aleñados  como ocurrio en ibague. Deben moverse por distintos lugares. Tambien las marchas deberian concentrarse en los lugares donde viven los Politicos y miembros del gobierno. Porque no desesperar a los Politicos desde sus residencias? Vayan a los barrios mas ricos donde viven los congresistas y denles un susto. Ahi si se hacen las cosas.

Contra los bloqueos estoy totalmente en contra porque afecta mas de lo que ayuda. Aqui puse varios posts de lo malo que es para las personas que no tienen nada. Afecta a Campesinos y millones de negocios pequeños de toda indole. Se arma presion pero la s repercusiones economicas son peores. Aunque tambien esta justificado porque el gobierno en serio tiene muy abandonados a los Camioneros. Ya son muy pasados. Es tan solo ver los peajes tan caros que les ponen.

Contra el vandalismo no estoy de acuerdo pero pues eso pasa en todas las marchas worldwide. Creo tiene validez eso de que a veces es la unica forma que los gobiernos pongan atencion. Si hacen marchas pacificas al gobierno le vale \*\*\* asi de malos son los politicos, A ellos no le importa discutir pacificamente. Tristemente las personas se ven afectadas y eso tambien me parece fatal. Es una encrucijada contra la pared."
2751,"Los apoyo? No

Pero entiendo que las protestas pacíficas simplemente no nos van a llevar a nada, especialmente con la manada de corruptos que nos gobiernan."
2752,"...los bienes fisicos (edificios y demas) tienen seguros, de eso estoy muy seguro, por eso cuando dicen que los costos son, yeah, ya se que es propaganda..."
2753,"Las vías de hecho no son lo mejor en mi opinión, pero en cierto modo transmiten un mensaje diferente al de la propia protesta pacífica y deben ser entendidad en su contexto. 

De lo que estoy seguro, descartando la posibilidad de infiltrados, es que quien daña la propiedad privada o realiza bloqueos se siente agredido e ignorado por la sociedad en su conjunto, y esa cólera almacenada la expulsa de esa forma no sólo para hacerse notar sino para decir ""acá nadie se salva, ni ustedes"". Como tratando de meter la empatia por las malas al meter a los demás en su situación de precariedad (ojo, es mi hipótesis)"
2754,"Las protestas en pocas palabras, son una minoría imponiendo sus ideales sobre la mayoría. En este caso la mayoría voto por duque, y solo algo como 2 millones de personas están protestando, en su mayoría estudiantes sin experiencia laboral, económica o de vida. 

Para los que digan que es un movimiento masivo, si puede que lo sea, pero sigue siendo una minoría del país de 45 millones. 

Se ven mucho énfasis en los avisos policiales, que lastimosamente han habido, pero no se habla de la mayoría de protestas, con presencia de policía y ESMAD, que terminan sin altercados. Hablan de los policías que se pasan, pero no hablan de los daños a infraestructura que se han realizado por parte de los protestantes, no hablan de las pérdidas económicas en los privados que simplemente no pueden trabajar, dónde quedan sus derechos entonces?, Dónde quedó el derecho al trabajo de las personas que han sido despedidas por causa del paro? Considerando que cualquier ciudadano puede hacer una propuesta de ley, porque los líderes del paro no lo han hecho?

Hay acusaciones de que el gobierno quiere desacreditar el paro, pero todos los medios estatales ( teleantioquia, Canal 1, CityTv etcétera) están enfocados en remarcar las protestas pacíficas. Son los privados los que los desacreditan, porque no nos conviene, el paro genera perdidas económicas irreparables, hace más difícil importar o exportar, la calificación de riesgo del país se va a la mierda, lo que implica que no hay inversión extragera, es decir menos empleo, para los mismos que están protestando. 

Para empeorar, la ráfaga de falsa información en redes están jodiendo más toda la situación, ya ni siquiera saben porque están protestando. Va a pasar lo de siempre, el gobierno les dice que si a todo, y en dos años no cumple nada, porque su intención era detener el paro, no realizar una mejora de las situación del país. 

En conclusión, la protesta es por mucho la peor forma de participación ciudadana, es propensa a la intervención de mal intencionados, genera efectos secundarios severos y violenta los derechos de personas que no tienen interés en el tema. Si alguien quiere contradecir esto, por favor que mencioné otra forma de participación peor."

El problema es que el estado solo escucha a los ricos, los militares y las élites políticas y sociales. Si se lograra convencer a esa gente, el estado tal vez escuche."
2756,Pero como afectar a todo el pueblo bloqueando vías y no centrarse en los políticos va a ayudar a que se reduzca la corrupción?
2757,"Apoyo lo que dices pero voy un poco más allá.... todos los Tombos son unos hps y hay mucho bruto suelto defendiendo a los corruptos.

2758,"La mayoría ni salió a votar por Duque, ni petro y ni por el voto en blanco."
2759,">  Si se lograra convencer a esa gente, el estado tal vez escuche.
 
¿A los ricos, los militares y las élites políticas y sociales? ¿Cómo los vas a convencer? Se supone que son ellos los que tienen mejor educación, mejores oportunidades y no están tan agobiados por las vicisitudes. De hecho, esas élites se auto-denominan ""gente de bien"" (que por descarte significa que los que no piensen igual son ""gente de mal"" o algo así). 

Uno esperaría que las élites asumieran la responsabilidad de enderezar el país pero, desafortunadamente, el puesto se lo reparten entre los ultra snobs que aún creen que estamos en el Virreinato de Nueva Granada, los caporales que piensan que todo esto es una finca, los camanduleros y rezanderos de oficio y todos los recién vestidos que se han beneficiado de la cultura traqueta. 

Volvemos a lo mismo, no es culpa de la gente del común que el Estado no escuche la protesta pacífica. El Estado es el culpable, es precisamente su actuación la que propicia la degeneración de la protesta. 

Pues ya que el Estado no tiene intenciones de cambiar pues yo me resigné que a seguirán habiendo bloqueos y vandalismo, que es la evolución natural del conflicto ¿Qué se le va a hacer?"
2760,"Eso crea más descontento, y en términos generales es descontento con los políticos. En sí lo único que hace es meterles presión y les da un poco de temor en que la violencia escale en contra de ellos y sus bienes.

Además centrarse en la política no es un caso viable en nuestra actualidad, un ejemplo reciente es el plebiscito anti corrupción y votación por la paz."

Acabar la guerra con armamento no letal, gases de humo y aturdidoras? El OP nos acaba la guerra en 3 meses y de paso recupera Panama

Te digo mi opinión, la guerra ideológica acabó hace bastante años siendo generosos, acabó en el tratado de Paz, lo que hay ahora es una guerra contra las drogas y narcotraficantes que se escudan diciendo que luchan por cierta ideologia, y que es lo que pasa, que la guerra contra las drogas la perdimos cuando nos dimos cuenta que matar a los capos no sirvió para nada, y que para rematar no se combate el problema de raíz. 

Si el gobierno no invierte en infraestructura en el campo, vías, acceso, salud, educación, oportunidades laborales, los cultivos solo irán en aumento y de igual forma las ganancias de los narcos. Y eso es lo que ningún gobierno ha hecho. 

No digo que no hay que utilizar al ejercito, hay que seguir usandolo e invertir más en el, porque gente peligrosa siempre va a existir, pero el problema de las drogas va mucho más de combatirla con armas."

Todo eso se resume en un concepto basico: falta de sentido comun. La gente es capaz de llegar a extremos para probar q su punto es el correcto, para mostrar q no se equivocaron, y es esa fuerza pujante de extremo y extremo que acaba siempre en violencia y muertes.

Ahora yo si menciono un punto adicional, la solucion en un mundo ideal seria quedarse en el medio, un punto equilibrado donde tanto ideas liberales como ideas conservadoras puedan vivir armoniosamente. Lastimosamente, siempre habra gente queriendo extremar la balanza, y la unica forma de contrarrestar ese ataque, es actuando de la misma manera en el otro lado. Extrañamente la mejor forma de mantener un equilibrio, es precisamente parandose en un extremo."

2778,"Ni siquiera es protestar por derecho, sino cuando se usan las protestas y los clamores populares justificados para impulsar una narrativa especifica y hacer exigencias no apegadas a la realidad por el grado de imposibilidad para ser cumplidas a cabalidad.

Hay muchas cosas que suponen un problema en lo que propone el mal llamado comite del paro, con algunas propuestas siendo, de entrada, francamente incumplibles (irrealizables). El ejemplo mas obvio es la peticion de ""no discriminacion por genero, diversidad sexual y etnica"" . ¿Como planean hacer que eso se cumpla?, ¿acaso quieren que se encarcele a cualquier ciudadano que exhiba alguna conducta discriminatoria contra alguno de los grupos en cuestion hasta que la gente sienta miedo o algo asi?. Por mas educacion que haya al respecto o castigo al irrespeto a dichas normas, siempre va a haber alguien que rechace cualquier codigo implementado para proteger a esos grupos y exhiba esas conductas de una u otra forma y en cualquier escenario. El gobierno podria hacer de su parte dentro de las instituciones que lo componen pero, ¿como se asegura el cumplimiento por parte de la sociedad?

Otra cosa en el mismo sentido es que quieren mayores beneficios sociales pero, ¿como esperan que se paguen si no quieren asumir mas cargas tributarias?. Si, ya hemos oido a Petro, a Wilson Arias y compañia hablando de que se le cobre mas impuestos al sector financiero y los grandes capitales y eso esta bien, pero hay un limite porque, de lo contrario, esa gente simplemente va a recoger la plata que maneja y se va a ir a otro lado con ella. Tambien hay discusiones sobre combatir la evasion fiscal y la corrupcion pero los resultados en estos frentes no se verian de la noche a la mañana. Fuera de eso, Petruchis y compañia hablan de otros mecanismos de financiacion como imprimir dinero, prestamos del Banco de la Republica y reversa a beneficios tributarios para algunos grupos; sin embargo, ¿es suficiente dinero para todo?, ¿son fiables los mecanismos destinados a la recaudacion de ese dinero? o ¿está garantizada su fiabilidad en el tiempo?.

Los impuestos son necesarios y debe haber mayor equidad en la asignacion de la carga tributaria en el sentido de que cada quien tiene que pagar de acuerdo a sus capacidades, pero no puede hablarse de menos impuestos para un gasto publico cada vez mayor.

Tambien esta el tema de la legitimacion del vandalismo, el terrorismo antiestatal  y anticiudadano y de quienes cometen estos actos al equipararlos con los que salen pacificamente a protestar, mientras se deslegitima el actuar de la fuerza publica de forma generalizada, por parte de elementos involucrados en este paro. Hemos visto como incluso pseudodefensores de derechos humanos como Ariel Avila legitiman el vandalismo de grupos de jovenes al decir que es una respuesta a la violencia del estado, cuando se ha visto que esas conductas antisociales son premeditadas y organizadas."
2779,"Que gran thread. Asi es. Las personas siguen la politica como si fuera una religion. El sentido comun se ha perdido. Ya las personas no son capaces de tener conversaciones. Solo odio y peleas de un bando a otro que no resuelven nada y crean un loop de destruccion infinito. Nadie es capaz de dar puntos con objetividad-sin biases porque tienen que ser fiel a su partido asi haga las cosas mal. No se trata de izquierdas-derechas-centros. se trata de hacer las cosas con tacto,razonamiento y tener discusiones significativas sin oprimir al otro para mejorar el mundo.

No, el daño es real. Que dicen los manifestantes es que hay cosas mucho mas importante. Es la idea de hacer alguien dolor para entender como se siente. No para justificar el daño hecho, para aclaración de que opinan.

2787,"Tienes razón, es bueno tener posturas pero hay que cuidarse de no ir al punto de cerrarse a otras posturas y negar la realidad o la realidad de otros. Por eso también es respetable los que no apoyan el paro o los que quieren que ya se termine, hay personas que en estos momentos están teniendo perdidas gigantes ya sean económicas, de salud, laborales, etc, pero estas personas son atacadas con frases como ""te falta empatía"", frase con la que solo intentan hacer sentir culpables a personas que piensen diferente."
2788,"Discrepo totalmente. Este es solo consecuencia de no solo un gobierno ineficiente, aunado con los estragos de la pandemia, sino de un histórico y descarado monopolio de las armas de los gobiernos de turno. Desde el gobierno de Laureano Gómez, pasando por Rojas Pinilla, López Michelsen, Virgilio Barco hasta el más asqueroso de todos, el gobierno ha prometido muchas cosas para luego matar a las personas que exigen sus derechos constitucionales."
2789,"El zurdo radical no oculta un fascista detrás de su mascara, eso sería una inconsistencia mayor con su sistemas de principios. En cambio, este podría tener ciertas aspiraciones autoritarias que son naturales en personas de cualquier ideología.

Hago mea culpa por tener momentos donde ignoro que existen otras posturas diferentes del autoritarismo Uribista (me he considerado como alguien de izquierda casi toda mi vida, es decir, como unos 15 años). No obstante, es necesario entender que dichas conductas no son gratuitas pues he sido descalificado, insultado, amenazado, despedido, y otras cosas impensables en una democracia por ir en contra de ciertas ideas y personajes... Uno se deja contagiar ese odio, ojalá fuese más sabio para disminuir eso e inclusive romper el ciclo.

Cierro con un pensamiento que siempre he tenido sobre las tesis de extremos y su malestar para el país, y es que tenemos otros males, llámese tibieza, indiferencia, importaculistas, o como sea... Es esa gente que dice ""todos los políticos son unas ratas"", ""yo ni voto, eso pa que sirve"", ""Petro y Uribe son la misma basura"", parte del problema es el no querer participar o hacerlo por medio de posiciones donde solo se busca tener decoro y proteger ante todo la forma, sin que se tenga un objetivo realista."

&#x200B;

te dejo una frase de un filosofo chino:

&#x200B;

“El camino perfecto sólo es difícil para los que eligen,  
no gustes ni disgustes y todo estará claro.  
Si quieres la verdad clara frente a ti, nunca estés a favor o en contra.  
El conflicto entre a favor y en contra es la peor enfermedad de la mente.”  
Jianzhi Sengcan - Siglo V D.C."
2796,"> El ejemplo mas obvio es la peticion de ""no discriminacion por genero, diversidad sexual y etnica"" . 

Nadie espera que el Estado pueda garantizar, por ejemplo, el derecho a la vida en un 100% de la población (sería una belleza que en un país como Colombia hubiese cero homicidios), eso no impide que esté planteado en las leyes y los programas de gobierno (y sus actuaciones) al menos como un *desideratum*. 

>pero hay un limite porque, de lo contrario, esa gente simplemente va a recoger la plata que manejan y se va a ir a otro lado con ella. 

Lo hermoso del concepto de libre mercado es que, si existe demanda de algo (por ejemplo de servicios financieros) el sistema incentiva el que otros ofrezcan sus servicios y así obtengan ganancias (por el cuento de la racionalidad de los entes económicos). La banca es tan buen negocio que, te lo aseguro, si se van esos que dices vendrán otros a ocupar su lugar. 

>¿es suficiente dinero para todo?, ¿son fiables los mecanismos destinados a la recaudacion de ese dinero? o ¿está garantizada su fiabilidad en el tiempo?

Pues lo mismo pudiera decirse de las medidas que había planteado anteriormente el gobierno. Duque pretendía que alguien estrato cuatro (la clase media) pagase 19% de más en sus cuentas de servicios, empezase a declarar renta (porque uno esperaría que ganase más de 1.6MM de pesos al año), empezase a pagar IVA por todos esos otros rubros que antes estaban exentos y, de paso, encajase la inflación que iba a venir cuando todos los productos subiesen de precio por razones obvias y todo lo demás que dejé por fuera. ¿Cuántos de esos estrato cuatro iban a quedar luego en el estrato tres? ¿En dónde crees tú que igual van a recaer los impuestos cuando se amplíe aún más la inequidad económica (de la que Colombia está en el top 5 del mundo) y quede un país sólo de pobres y ultra ricos?

Igual hay muchas otras estrategias de recaudación que van más allá de lo que estás planteando. Hay mucho dinero en Colombia pero, desafortunadamente, muy mal distribuido."
2797,">Ni siquiera es protestar por derecho, sino cuando se usan las protestas y los clamores populares justificados para impulsar una narrativa especifica y hacer exigencias no apegadas a la realidad por el grado de imposibilidad para ser cumplidas a cabalidad.

¿De donde sacas que no es por derecho? creo que entiendo lo que decís con la narrativa especifica, pero creo que igual es parte de una democracia que suficiente cantidad de personas se pongan de acuerdo para hacer un reclamo. No creo que se trate de ""manipulación"" de la opinión pública, en todo caso eso lo ejercen los medios tradicionales.


>  El ejemplo mas obvio es la peticion de ""no discriminacion por genero, diversidad sexual y etnica"" . ¿Como planean hacer que eso se cumpla?, ¿acaso quieren que se encarcele a cualquier ciudadano que exhiba alguna conducta discriminatoria contra alguno de los grupos en cuestion hasta que la gente sienta miedo o algo asi?.

La propuesta debe estar mejor formulada que esto. si tenés algún documento que comente cual sería el procedimiento sería muy instructivo, porque estaríamos suponiendo sobre la nada. 

> Otra cosa en el mismo sentido es que quieren mayores beneficios sociales pero, ¿Cómo esperan que se paguen si no quieren asumir mas cargas tributarias?.

Las financiaciones estatales se pueden hacer de muchas formas, en este momento igual ya hay una carga impositiva sobre las grandes empresas, pero hay muchísimo despilfarre gubernamental y súmale a eso la corrupción, creo que esta clarísimo que el estado podría recaudar más y gastar menos habiendo tantos mecanismos y formas de hacerlo sin perjudicar tanto a las clases media y baja. No pensar en todas estas variables es un error grave.


> Tambien esta el tema de la legitimacion del vandalismo, el terrorismo antiestatal  y anticiudadano y de quienes cometen estos actos al equipararlos con los que salen pacificamente a protestar, mientras se deslegitima el actuar de la fuerza publica de forma generalizada, por parte de elementos involucrados en este paro. Hemos visto como incluso pseudodefensores de derechos humanos como Ariel Avila legitiman el vandalismo de grupos de jovenes al decir que es una respuesta a la violencia del estado, cuando se ha visto que esas conductas antisociales son premeditadas y organizadas.

Deslegitimar el acto de la fuerza publica no es legitimar el vandalismo, hace la cuenta respecto a cuantos policías / manifestantes muertos hay y es un dato más que completo para hacerte entender la gravedad de la situación, sumando a esto desapariciones forzadas, violaciones y heridos. 

Si seguimos hablando de ""terrorismo vandálico antiestatal"" estamos cayendo en la retórica paranoide de la ultra derecha."

2801,"La polarización es nociva para cualquier democracia. Los colombianos deberíamos sabernos esa lección de memoria. Pero después de 50 años parece que aún no aprendemos.

La polarización significado que una población encuentra cada vez menos puntos en común sobre los cuales legislar y salir adelante. Significa que inevitablemente una porción de la sociedad se va a sentir marginados por las decisiones del estado.

En una sociedad polarizada es más difícil dialogar. Cuando se pierde el diálogo, el único recurso que queda es la violencia."
2802,"No señor, la polarización se hace uno intolerante de los puntos buenos de unos y complaciente con los malos de otros.

Una person naturalmente no debería estar de acuerdo con todos los opiniones de un político. Por eso tiene que estar abierto y escuchar los argumentos de todos."

Lo más importante creo yo es no perder de vista el macro, y para mi es cierto que es un bajon que haya perdidas económicas, pero me parece más grave que haya perdidas humanas. Hay una balanza que realmente no se puede ni siquiera hacer. 

Vandalismo? y si, debe haber, pero realmente, ¿cuantos son en comparación a los que protestan pacificamente? porque esos casos de protesta pacifica que deben ser la mayoría no salen en los medios porque no llaman la atención. Es muy necesario que hagamos siempre el balance de quién tiene el poder y quién lo reclama y porqué."
2810,¿Y en que estamos discrepando exactamente?
2811,"Estoy muy de acuerdo, yo era de los cínicos que decía que votar no sirve, pero justamente entre menos la gente vote menos sirve. De igual forma cuestiono bastante el sistema de votación basado en promesas, un cargo público debería ser algo que te comprometa más y no una silla para cobrar una mensualidad. 

te dejo un video que me dejó pensando mucho: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8vVEbCquMw

&#x200B;

Lo del zurdo radical lo digo porque lo escuche de más de una persona de izquierda, el mismo discurso de un fascista ""hay que matarlos a todos"" ""hay que pasarlos por las armas"" ""hay que limpiar el país"". El fascismo extermina personas de forma sistemática y por definición es autoritario. Hay una frase que dice ""El camino al infierno esta lleno de buenas intenciones"", seguro hubo más de un dictador que pensaba que lo que hacía era correcto, pero eso también te habla de cómo la ideología te puede desconectar de la realidad."
2812,"No creo que te hayan obligado a protestar. Te obligan en todo caso a no protestar: pum pum! ""ratas, vagos, vayan a trabajar"" pum pum!"
2813,"En eso los canadienses van mejor: cuatro partidos (aunque en realidad mandan dos uniendose al tercero que este potente de turno).

Lo malo es la excesiva feudizacion de nuestro pais: en Colombia el que no le gusta el partido se abre y funda otro mini partido suficiente para sumarla a la coalicion de turno aunque incapaz de representar el sentir ciudadano:

* Uribe no queria que lo mandara Gaviria y armo el CD.
* Unos liberales no querian a Gaviria tampoco y fundaron cambio radical (y Lleras se lo trago).
* Otros liberales no querian a gaviria y se abrieron y fundaron el partido de la U
* Robledo no queria el Polo y se fundo Dignidad.
* Petro tampoco queria que el polo lo manejara y armo la Colombia Humana
* Los verdes son un revuelto el berraco.
* Mira son pastores, esos son rancho aparte de por si.

(Solo liste los representativos)

Es decir, tenemos partidos de sobra pana. El problema es que salvo el tradicional liberal y conservador, todos los demas han sido caudillos que no querian negociar con nadie sino mandar en su propio chuzo. No hay voluntad real de negociar. Ese cacicazgo es muy berraco de manejar.

Si negociar entre dos era berraco te imaginas ahora ? 

Como dato curioso: Israel es otro pais similar a Colombia en ese aspecto: regueros de partiditos, eso es un gallo armar un gobierno alla (democracia parlamentaria) por razones similares. Alla, al igual que aca no se trata de gobernar por un buen pais sino gobernar para complacer los politicos de turno. 

En lo unico que coinciden mayoritariamente alla es cuando israel esta bajo ataque. Y aca en la seleccion Colombia :("
2814,"Los sistemas tienen que ir cambiando. En lo personal opino que una meritocracia vigilada es mucho mejor que el sistema de roscas y favores políticos que se ha ido desplazando.

Así como tambien pienso que a veces se carga mucho al estado de procesos de control en algunos casos más pesados y costosos que el mismo gasto que se intenta realizar.

Está bien hacer auditoría, pero a veces acudirán hasta quien les va a vender una resma de papel, haciendo lento y muy costoso adquirir cosas simples y el gobierno se vuelve lento y burocratico"
2815,"Me empezaron a downvotear de la nada, yo diria que si jajaja"
2816,"Las personas con posiciones polarizadas son buenas en una democracia, pues eso permite al resto de las personas tener referencias para definir donde quedan en un debate político. Si eliminamos los extremos, nos quedamos en un mundo donde el cambio está limitado a hacerse de manera incremental. Y, pues, no es claro que limitarse a cambios incrementales sea bueno.

Un ejemplo, relevante para Colombia, es el debate sobre la financiación y control de la policía en Estados Unidos, donde hay una posición extrema que quiere abolir la institución de la policía y otra que quiere una policía militarizada. Son esos extremos los que ayudan a los votantes a definir su posición. Sin esos extremos, probablemente no habría debate acerca de la razón de ser de la policía y todos aceptaríamos el estado actual de las cosas sin cuestionamientos."
2817,"Hacer aliados, dejar de querer tener razón y abrirse a lo que el otro tenga para decir, y si lo que tiene para decir es un discurso repetido probablemente haya que hacerle las preguntas adecuadas para que se cuestione."
2818,"La polarización total es obviamente mala. Pero comenzar a excluir los extremos, personas con posiciones polarizadas, de los debates políticos es un error. Esas personas nunca van a dejar de existir. En algunos casos es imposible encontrar un punto medio, por ejemplo con el debate sobre el aborto. Ese debate, que por definición está polarizado, es facilitado por las posiciones extremas."
2819,"No es cuestión de querer ser más o menos polarizado. Siempre van a haber personas con una línea de pensamiento polarizada, y no por eso tenernos que excluirlas de los debates políticos. Esas personas van a utilizar argumentos que posiblemente una persona en el centro nunca va a considerar. Para poder tomar una posición propia, es mucho más fácil si se tienen referencias de distintos puntos de vista, incluyendo los extremos."

2826,"Es todo un planteo pensar en una infraestructura que permita la revisión y el monitoreo de las actividades institucionales sin caer en la burocracia. 

Es como cuando los más liberales dicen que los beneficios que provee el estado tendrían que estar en manos de las corporaciones. ¿Cómo evitas los monopolios e incentivas al juego limpio? Con el estado pasa lo mismo. Por eso insisto que el problema no es el sistema sino las motivaciones de los individuos."

2828,"Me parece que estas confundiendo polarización con diversificación. Al menos en política, cuando hablamos de polarizar estamos hablando de 2 extremos, estamos hablando de posiciones encontradas intransigentes sin predisposición para la negociación y en cuyas posturas se limita a los individuos a comprar paquetes de ideas generando pensamientos homogéneos en ambos extremos. Te sugiero que revises el concepto. El extremismo siempre lleva al radicalismo y es la principal causa de violencia. No veo ningún beneficio para una democracia en ello."
2829,"Más allá de la controversia se escuda continuamente en taparse los ojos más allá de una duda razonable. Cada vez que se discute un tema el desvía la atención con dudas irrelevantes o con expresiones para desviar la mirada a detalles menores.

Por ejemplo se habla de que los indígenas los recibieron a bala. Hay 8 heridos algunos de gravedad.

El sale, ah pero estaban bloqueando. Y ellos también estaban armados.

Aquí el hecho a repudiar fue el hecho que les dispararon civiles, y la policía no hizo nada. El sale a detallas que estaban bloqueando o que también estaban armados que se metieron a un conjunto.

El caso reciente de la menor de edad que se suicidó después de que denunciará abusos de la policía.

Ahh no es que ella nunca piso instalaciones de la policía porque la uri no es de la policía sino de la fiscalía.

Para el nada paso a menos de que pasen un vídeo mostrando el acto mismo. Y aún así me preguntó con que argumentos saldría para refutarlo? Va a salir que es un montaje? Un deep fake? Ah no es que no se sabe que pasó justo antes del video.

El abusa del concepto de duda razonable más allá para seguir tapandose los ojos de que aquí no pasa nada. que a pesar de una lista ya interminable de incoherencias que están pasando en el país. 
Para el es más importante tener la absoluta seguridad de que no hay una duda alguna. Y la duda es más importante que pensar ""Hay hay algo mal aquí"".


Hey pero es que no fue la policía porque la uri es de la fiscalía.

Es que en el vídeo no se ve que abusan de ella.

Es que no se ve que pasó antes.

Están seguros que no tiro piedra?"
2830,"Pasa que la mayoría piensa que al ser polos opuestos no puede existir en su contradicción. La izquierda cree que busca la libertad y la igualdad y la derecha cree que defiende lo que hace que las pocas cosas que están bien estén bien.

2831,"Es entendible aceptable y correcto que un politico se vaya de un partido donde considere que no concuerda con los ideales del partido. Sin embargo, seria mucho mas entendible que se fuera para otro partido ya fundado. Pero eso generalmente nunca pasa. Se van y fundan partido propio de 2-4 politicos.

Si alguien se va de un partido politico porque no estuvo de acuerdo con las decisiones de la mayoria del partido, que esperanzas hay que esa persona sea un negociador en su propio partido ? eso demuestra su personalidad: cacique, aqui mando yo. Y esto les cae a todos, a Uribe, a Petro, a benedetti, a Robledo, al mismo Fajardo (aunque seamos sinceros le quedaba muy duro elegir con quien irse - todos eran y son demasiado politiqueros).

No es facil papi. El problema no es Duque presidente, son los congresistas (aunque Duque paga la primiparada, el man le falta experiencia y nunca obtuvo nivel de ser un verdadero presidente). 

En vez de bloquear las ciudades, deberiamos esperar que el congreso este en sesion y rodear el congreso y protestar alli hasta que arreglen esta vaina. Ellos son los que siempre han tenido el verdadero poder.  (pero no se me haria raro que el congreso tuviera tuneles)"
2832,Tenia 7 :/
2833,"Yo le dije lo mismo, pero según él, pone información de los dos lados, de igual forma creo que toda esa información lo único que hace es invisibilizar lo que pasa realmente como vos decís, mi punto es que si le seguimos respondiendo con bronca por la indignación que genera nunca va a estar abierto a darse cuenta del daño q hace ni va a estar abierto a cambiar de opinión."
2834,"de hecho creo que duque es una muestra de las contradicciones que hablamos es una mezcla de elementos de izquierda y derecha fallidos, la peor reforma tributaria ever y no es que no fuera necesaria pero habian formas de buscar recortar el gasto pero nadie tiene los cojones de hacerlo"
2835,"o te sueltan a las abejas o a los perros, o a los perros que escupen abejas (?

Teorías hay muchas, para mi la más probable es la de que están todos cohercionados por el cartel y los paras. Al menos acá en Colombia. Duque actúa como un títere.

La gente también bloquea las ciudades porque es la única forma popular conocida que funcionó alguna vez para hacerle reclamos a un gobierno.

Estoy de acuerdo en que debe haber una más eficiente, pero si lo van a hacer, tienen derecho a hacerlo."
2836,es que ahí en ese congreso el que no esta cagado en amenazas es una basura que le importa un carajo llenarse el bolsillo con el dinero de las arcas públicas.
2837,"mmmm No diria que tienen derecho porque se estan extralimitando y violentando los derechos del resto de la poblacion. El hecho que no tengan suficiente visibilidad es cierto pero no los autoriza. Honestamente no veo diferencia entre ""bloquean porque no los escuchan""  y ""robaba porque tenia hambre"".

Cada dia que pasa el bloqueo se polariza mas la situacion. Ya algunos se radicalizaron y ya hay muertos y heridos porque la poblacion civil se levanto. Si los bloqueos no se controlan simple y llanamente vamos a guerra civil (aunque aun falta bastante). Ya tenemos muy mala experiencia con los grupos paramilitares, lo que menos necesitamos es que un grupo se tome el ""derecho"" de violentar a otros y grupos de empresarios se reunan y decidan financiar a otros grupos de defensa.

Antes teniamos un grupo que se sentia oprimido (violentado olvidado, etc). Ahora tenemos ADICIONALMENTE un grupo que se siente oprimido por otro y por la inaccion del ejecutivo. Como crees que va a ser la proxima vez que haya convocatoria a paro ? consideras de verdad que los ciudadanos van a quedarse callados viendo como se prepara una nueva destruccion del mobiliario urbano y se preparan bloqueos ? es una linea muy, muy peligrosa la que estamos trazando.
 
Cual crees que va a ser la linea principal de los candidatos a elecciones ? los candidatos los elige el pueblo por ser masa (manipulada o no) pero el ejecutivo gobierna con la clase alta porque en el sistema capitalista si las empresas no colaboran se cae el sistema. Entonces ... necesitan de parte y parte y en mi opinion, en general (no todos) las acciones del ejecutivo estan causando resentimiento y desconfianza, mas aun, en las clases media y alta. Y un sistema capitalista sin esas clases se friega."

Esto es indiscutible y no podría estar más de acuerdo, de hecho, si hubiera más clase media y alta recaudarían muchísimo más y se evitarían todo este lío. Pero las protestas son justamente porque no hay forma de escalar. En Colombia se necesitan entre 5 y 9 generaciones para salir de la pobreza, ¿y cómo van a reclamar los pobres? ¿votando y participando del mismo sistema que los margina? 

No te digo que no entiendo tu punto. Tu punto es claro, no hay necesidad de vandalizar y frenar la economía del país.
Pero esos actos los perpetua en su mayoría gente radical, gente radical que existe por proposiciones como ""no tienen derecho a protestar"" ""son todos vandalos"" ""son todos ratas y guerrilleros"" lo único que hacen esas declaraciones son echar más leña al fuego. ¿Querés que dejen de cortar las rutas y romper negocios? Habría que escuchar que tienen para decir. Pero en vez de eso le disparan incluso a gente que no esta participando de estos actos vandálicos que justamente existen porque no los escuchan.

Es peligroso pensar de una manera tan tajante respecto a los derechos de los demás, porque crea esta generalización para desacreditar marchas por culpa de un porcentaje pequeño de gente resentida y enojada (y con razón) porque si estuvieras en su lugar nunca dirías algo como ""se están extralimitando""."
2840,"De acuerdo. Lo que quiero resaltar es que en mi opinion, la situacion es menos buena hoy en general. 

Si la protesta no hubiera vandalizado las ciudades, si el MIO en cali no hubiera sido quemado, si las ciudades no estuvieran bloqueadas, me atrevo a decir que hoy habria mas apoyo general a la protesta. Casi todos los colombianos la apoyamos pero cuando empezo el vandalismo, la violencia y los bloqueos, el apoyo popular se disminuyo. Hay grupos que la apoyan claro, pero anda a Cali y pregunta hoy como se siente con el paro y como se sentian hace dos semanas y va a ser una gran diferencia.

Perdieron las ciudades que tienen mobiliario urbano destruido. Perdieron los empresarios que no pueden sacar sus productos, perdio el pueblo que se quedo sin empleo y sin transporte. Lo peor ? el pueblo no tiene plan b mientras las clases medias les duele pero pueden pagar comida al doble de precio.

Manana negocian, los dirigentes del paro se vuelven parte del ejecutivo, reciben su tajada y el pueblo quedo endeudado, las ciudades destruidas y la clases media y altas quedaron dolidas y resentidas. No vamos a ganar nada asi, en total vamos a perder mas.

Respondo tu pregunta que sospecho es sarcastica: si, los pobres (y los ricos) reclaman VOTANDO. Haciendo uso del poder mas bravo que existe que es ese voto. Pero me atrevo a jurar que al menos el 50% (yo creeria que mas) no votaron ni votaran para marzo 2022. Esa accion vale mucho (ha sido la base de varias guerras desde el feudalismo, la colonia, etc.) pero si venden su consciencia ... no se puede hacer mucho, tenemos el pais que nos merecemos.

Ivan Ospina, alcalde de Cali no es santo de mi devocion pero hay que reconocerle algo: ha hecho todo lo posible, demasiado en opinion de muchos, para escuchar los miembros del paro. Y solo ha recibido maltrato, amenazas e injurias. Los miembros del paro timidamente dicen que no apoyan la violencia. Repito, TIMIDAMENTE. Apoyan los bloqueos de la economia bajo lo que se podria entender como una mentalidad: ""que se jodan todos, que sufran lo que sufrimos, no se que somos pobres y nadie nos oye ?""

Un pais no lo vamos a construir con esos pensamientos, al menos no uno bueno."

2850,"Sí. Las representa. Su construcción representa una maniobra típica de los gobiernos de corte autoritario: preparar un gran teatro gastando una plata considerable para inaugurar un monumento nacionalista mientras en el campo los militares cagan a tiros a campesinos que protestaban. Se construyó en el contexto de La Violencia y del surgimiento de las Farc, del envío de soldados colombianos sin motivo alguno a morir en la Guerra de Correa.

Un monumento fascista no te dice: ""Viva el fascismo"". Un monumento fascista celebra el nacionalismo militar, como Mussolini celebraba al Imperio romano para crear un sustento histórico artificial de su movimiento. Todo eso mientras se desvía la atención de otras cosas que podía hacer el gobierno o, lo que es lo mismo, mientras se le lava el cerebro a la gente para hacerles creer que lo que están haciendo sus gobernantes (inaugurar monumentos, matar campesinos, enviar soldados inocentes a Corea) es un deber patriótico."

2862,"La pregunta no es esa..... El monumento es fascista o fue hecho por un fascista???? Porque si tu comprensión del lenguaje castellano no va tan allá, te lo pudiera explicar...."
2863,"Exactamente, pero que se hace con alguien que no quiere salir de sus mente hueca."
2864,"Es un monumento nacionalista en la década de 1940 hecho por un conservador con nexos al falangismo, nazismo y fascismo. La arquitectura (el diseño como tal, ya separándolo del escultor) también se llama fascista, de manera que artísticamente también tiene ese adjetivo. No sabía que les preocupara tanto jaja.

>Es decir que si el man que le puso las letras es nazi, el man que puso la base de cemento es soviético, y el que hizo el molde de las estatuas es antisemita, entonces el monumento es facista-nazi-comunista-antisemita?

Eso es un hombre de paja porque yo no estoy hablando de los constructores, estoy hablando de los autores intelectuales de la obra. Los que se sentaron a decidir que debía haber un monumento nacionalista en pleno período de resurgimiento del nacionalismo, y luego decidir que el indicado para hacer eso debía ser alguien que trabajó para uno de los mayores nacionalistas entonces. No nos hagamos los bobos.

Solo estoy describiendo una obra (contextualizándola en la historia y en su movimiento artístico) y lo que pasó ahí ayer; esa foto me pareció una ironía y cierto triunfo, al menos cultural, contra unos dirigentes tradicionalmente conservadores. No estoy diciendo que lo tengan que tumbar ni estoy haciendo juicios de valor, de ninguna manera se puede insinuar por mi post, estoy DESCRIBIENDO. Cómo les duele, por Dios."
2865,"El escarabajo es un vehículo famosamente nazi, sí. ¿Y?"
2866,"Es un error de apreciación totalmente el suyo.

1. Piensa que hice un juicio de valor cuando no fue así
2. Utilicé un adjetivo para calificar una obra que histórica, política y hasta artísticamente se puede describir como ""fascista"". Si no les gusta que se defina histórica o políticamente como fascista (sabrá Dios por qué no, además de ese afán petulante de corregir a anónimos en internet porque dudo que estén en contra de las reuniones en Los Héroes) entonces deben aceptar, por lo menos, que artísticamente sí tiene ese adjetivo.
3. Por alguna razón todos los que empezaron a responder creen que como yo llamé ""fascista"" al monumento entonces yo defiendo no volverlo a usar o demolerlo o algo por el estilo, poniendo un montón de falsas equivalencias y más falacias para contradecir cosas que yo no dije y haciendo mucha gimnasia mental para interpretar siete palabras que escribí. ¿Qué tenía que ver que la Fanta o el Escarabajo, o las Autobahn o el Estadio de Berlín sean creaciones nazis? En ningún momento dije que no se deban usar, de hecho me parece un triunfo de la historia el hecho que gente contraria a las ideas nazistas o fascistas son las que utilizan la Autobahn y ocupan el Estadio de Berlín.

Si solo son capaces de ver simbolismo en el Muro de Berlín o en la Esvástica pues les falta mil capas más de profundidad para cavar. Al fin y al cabo a este país le falta eso: simbolismo, identidad, pero identidad en la lucha sobre todo. Normalizamos tanto las matanzas y los gobiernos conservadores amigos del autoritarismo que se les hace escandaloso cuando uno adjetiva de fascista un monumento público nacionalista ordenado por el gobierno durante La Violencia, como si el hecho de que la construcción del mayor monumento de Bogotá no implicara cierto performance teatral (con todo lo que una inauguración de esas implica en los medios) para cubrir cómo se trataba a los campesinos, al propio estilo dictatorial.

Por cierto, si no logran ver las similitudes entre el Monumento a los Héroes y la [EUR en Roma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EUR,_Rome#Architecture) pues tienen tanta miopía mental que no solo les nubló la ideología sino que les afectó la vista.

>La estructura construye un marco simétrico sobre el eje central del monumento, de modo que exterioriza los criterios geométricos que esconde, reconocibles entre otros aspectos por la monumentalidad de la escalera central, la proporción, la carencia de vanos perimetrales y la sensación de hermetismo de una pieza fundidas completa en concreto reforzado **y que se erige con unos de los pocos vestigios que existen en Colombia de una arquitectura emparentada con la ideología fascista.**

Me parece irreal tener que explicar el significado del título de mi post, que no significa nada más ni nada menos que lo que dice: un monumento fascista ocupado por la protesta social."
2867,Es fascista. Se llama arquitectura fascista.
2868,"La gaseosa Fanta fue inventada en Alemania Nazi, espero que no vuelvas a tomar una"
2869,"No era mejor escribir ""Monumento a los Héroes tomado por la protesta""? Colocar ""Monumento facista"" es en si teñir el post de un color político y darle un valor de juicio, en especial porque no estamos en un subreddit de historia y apreciación arquitectónica, ni en una cátedra de historia artística. Tampoco el post lo colocaste para hablar de los sutiles detalles políticos y artísticos del diseño del monumento. Qué esperabas?"
2870,Wall of text
2871,¿Qué parte de mi post implica que el hecho de que una cosa sea fascista (o nazi) no se puede volver a utilizar?
2872,"Es q todo se resume a que las ""cosas"" no toman partidos politicos, las ""cosas"" no tienen razon ni criterio para ser de derecha, fascistas, comunistas o lo que sea....las ""cosas"" son eso..""cosas"""
2873,"Mi mejor amiga es chocoana, nos conocimos en Bogotá cuando sus papás la enviaron a terminar el bachillerato alla por seguridad. 

Teníamos 12 años y nunca se me va olvidar todos los comentarios racistas e ignorantes q ella tuvo q soportar, es increíble cómo en un país mestizo hay gente q se cree superior por el simple hecho de ser pálidos.

Cuando teniamos como 15 años un muchacho mayor la amenazo ""por negra"", si no es por q sus hermanos mayores intervinieron quien sabe q le hubieran hecho.

Decir  grocerías esta permitido (ej: puta la cagué), dirigir esas grocerías a  otros usuarios con una clara intención de denigrar no está permitido  (ej: eres un maricón).

Recuerdo que al iniciar protestas denuncié un post donde otro usuario usaba groserías contra todos, me pareció que violaba las reglas en cuanto a hate y la respuesta fue que no pasaba nada, que todo bien. Entonces ¿cómo se moderan los moderadores? Porque dudo que todos trabajen así de objetivos."

Considerando que hay denuncias similares sobre las políticas de ambos Estados antes de que iniciaran las protestas y la respuesta de ambos - criminalización de la protesta, detenciones arbitrarias, muertes a manos de los organismos de seguridad, censura - durante las mismas; y si asumimos como cierto que la protesta es responsable de desabastecimiento, eliminación de puestos de trabajo, quiebra de empresas, contracción del agro y radicalización política necesariamente tenemos que asumir como cierta una de las dos afirmaciones:

1. La consecuencia de las protestas recae sobre los manifestantes y el gobierno está en el deber de emplear los medios a su alcance para restituir el orden público. Ello vindicaría la actuación de Maduro y de Chávez antes de él. 

2. La consecuencia de las protestas recae sobre el gobierno que no quiere ceder a las demandas sociales. Ello condenaría la actuación de Duque durante esta crisis. 

En ninguno de los dos casos sale bien parado el gobierno colombiano, sobre todo por el enorme empeño que ha puesto en rivalizar con el venezolano en cuestión de derechos humanos."

Caida la noche los que marcharon pacíficamente se quedan pasmados viendo como llegan unos personajes a sabotearse todo ese esfuerzo realizando vandalismo en bancos/droguerias...

2924,Gracias por tu comentario. Si siempre hay colados. Ojala vuelvan a protestas pacificas y impactantes!
2925,La única manera de protestar es en la que resulte en cambio y si es necesario destrucción masiva de propiedad pues que así sea.

&#x200B;

"""""" Paso 4: busca atraer, no dominar 

Cada movimiento busca corregir alguna injusticia, por lo que es fácil caer en la trampa de demonizar al otro lado. Sin embargo, aquí es donde muchos movimientos se descarrilan. La ira es un movilizador eficaz, pero la ira sin esperanza es una fuerza destructiva. Necesita presentar un caso afirmativo con tácticas afirmativas. Por eso es mejor comenzar con metas pequeñas y alcanzables. Los aliados de Gandhi cuestionaron su idea de hacer del impuesto a la sal un foco principal del movimiento de independencia de la India, porque estaban a favor de un plan para un cambio integral, pero vio que un solo problema, incluso uno pequeño, podría unificar la nación y romper el monopolio del Raj británico. en el poder.  Las tácticas baratas, fáciles de replicar y de bajo riesgo son las que tienen más probabilidades de éxito. Son la forma en que puede movilizar los números que necesita para influir en un pilar de poder, ya sea que esa influencia sea disruptiva, movilizadora o sacando a la gente del medio del espectro de aliados, especialmente si sus tácticas se consideran positivas y de buen humor.  Es muy probable que bloquear calles y tirar piedras a la policía ahuyente a los que están en medio de su espectro de aliados y hará que sea decididamente más difícil obtener el apoyo de las instituciones dentro de los pilares del poder. Durante las elecciones presidenciales estadounidenses de 2016, por ejemplo, los ""Bernie bros"" pueden haber enfurecido a los partidarios más fervientes de Bernie Sanders, pero probablemente desanimaron a muchos de los que necesitaba desesperadamente ganarse.

2981,"Considero muchísimo a las personas de ese país porque entiendo lo difícil que es trabajar para perder gran cantidad de tu sueldo en impuestos que irán a parar a los bolsillos de personas egoístas y corruptas que no tienen ningún interés en el país y su gente. Sin embargo, esta no es la manera, ciertamente. Ojalá todos podamos aspirar a una calidad de vida mejor con dirigentes decentes en un futuro cercano."
2982,"Ni tanto, mire japon, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eK--oCVP18A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eK--oCVP18A) la diferencia esta en la cultura y educacion general de la gente. Eso en nuestro pais hace mucho se perdio."
2983,"Pero destruyendo cosas no se saca nada, mucho menos cuando los afectados no son negocios de grandes corporaciones sino negocios familia, pequeños y medianos negocios, así como servicios utilizados por la misma ciudadanía como estaciones de servicios de transporte, etc."
2984,"Que pesar de el negocio común. Gente que lucha día a día para una comida. Las empresas grandes para eso tienen seguro, en unos días tendrán un cheque en la mano, por las empresas grandes no me siento mal. Lo que si me siento mal es de la gente que trabaja en esos negocios grande/pequeños. Que trabajo tendrán el día de mañana? Que pesar. Los culpables son los senadores, congresistas, gente en poder y el presidente Porky. Que asco."
2985,"Que me manden la cuenta de cobro del local. Pero fresco, que o se lo acababan estos vandalos o la reforma tributaria, alla vera."
2986,Bueno y cómo se llama el conocido del local? Porqué no le hacemos un gofundme o algo así? Cuente la historia completa porfa.
2987,Uy no qué mentalidad de esclavo la suya. Se merece lo que tiene.
2988,"Yo estoy hablando de los trabajadores del banco, si usted donde trabaja lo
Destruyen a donde lo mandan ?"
2989,"Literal usted tiene razón, el guarda es reubicado porque generalmente la seguridad es tercerizada, lo mismo la persona del aseo, y generalmente tanto el inmueble como lo que se almacena esta asegurado, el daño mas bien es para la aseguradora.

Edit: Además esas en posiciones tercerizadas guardas / empleados de aseo generalmente siempre necesitan personal porque alguien se enferma / se accidenta / tiene calamidades domesticas etc...

Elucubrando, a la persona del banco seguramente la pongan a cubrir turnos en otros lugares."
2990,"Creo yo que es una cosa romper vidrios y demas, y otra causar daños fisicos a alguien, en este caso el manager del banco tiene toda la culpa, sabiendo que hay una protesta lo que prima es la seguridad de los individuos, pero que mejor ejemplo del absoluto desinterés y falta de caracter ético y moral de estas instituciones que hacerlos ir a trabajar sin importar las consecuencias. En un pais como Polombia a los bancos no les interesa que les rompan los vidrios, asalten a sus empleados y demas, lo material esta asegurado por aseguradoras (que en su mayoria son de su propiedad) y si no el desgobierno les cubre los daños, respecto a los empleados....cual es el costo de contratar a alguien nuevo?, lamentablemente que alguien sufriera heridas si es el caso, pero es solo una muestra del valor de los individuos en una sociedad tan podrida como la de Polombia, lo mejor es que con todo y paro el desgobierno seguirá con su ""reforma"", solo queda esperar que lo que venga sea peor por que desafortunadamente no se ve otra salida."
2991,Usted es la clase de narcisistas que termina dañado a este país. 60% de la población en pobreza y usted ve una protesta en contra de una reforma que les pasa por encima como un acto de vandalismo. Usted debería retirarse de toda forma de comunicacion y dejar que las personas con un mínimo de empatia de hecho logre opinar.
2992,"Bueno, y qué pasó hoy? Cuáles son las cifras? Cuántos saqueos? Cuántas casas destruidas? Lo leo hablando de forma muy emocional. No veo datos."
2993,"La verdad es que un besaton jamás ha conseguido nada. Desde la revolucion francesa hasta el verano del 68, la gran mayoria de derechos humanos y sociales se han obtenido despues de protestas violentas ocasionadas por la enorme desigualdad."
2994,"No viejo, indigencia hay en todo el mundo. Lo que no hay son condiciones como las nuestras, donde la gran mayoría de la poblacion vive en la pobreza, y otros tantos en la miseria absoluta. Como pudo ver en el
Video, obras del gobierno como los baños pùblicos y los centros de reciclaje los ayudan a tener vidas más dignas."
2995,"Sí, los pequeños negocios y en general los bienes públicos deben ser protegidos. Pero un banco? En Colombia? Donde historicamente han hecho lo imposible para que el gobierno los salve de la ruina con nuestra plata al mismo tiempo que se eximen de impuestos que usted y yo terminamos pagando (vease: cuarenta reformas tributarias en setenta años) 

*cry me a river*"
2996,"> Pero destruyendo cosas no se saca nada, mucho menos cuando los afectados no son negocios de grandes corporaciones sino negocios familia, pequeños y medianos negocios, así como servicios utilizados por la misma ciudadanía como estaciones de servicios de transporte, etc.

No es que tenga sentido lo que están haciendo. Es estúpido. El punto es que la desesperación está llevando a la gente, cada vez más y más, a hacer este tipo de cosas estúpidas."
2997,[deleted]
2998,Pues tenia entendido que una de las principales razones de la marcha de ayer era para que no se le subieran los impuestos a nadie.
2999,Y cuántos dias va a durar el banco dañado?
3000,Y no solo eso. El banco lo arreglan y ya. Durará un dia o dos cerrado y ya todos vuelven a lo suyo. Cuántos bancos en la historia del país han cerrado una sede despues de un tropel?
3001,"De que habla usted?, desde cuando protestar se convirtió en sinónimo de hacer mierda los servicios públicos y destruir locales? Usted seguro es uno de esos vándalos que no tienen empatia por lo que destruyen, le cuento que todos esos buses y locales destruidos no se arreglaran por obra y gracia, usted debería retirarse de toda forma de comunicación y dejar que las personas con un mínimo de empatia y sentido de pertenencia logre opinar"
3002,[deleted]
3003,"Si, bueno... Tampoco soy amiga de una besatón o a convertirme en Gandhi. Pero me gustaría que las cosas fueran más ""civilizadas"". Algo muy utópico dadas las circunstancias."
3004,Si pero esas personas tenían miedo de morir y muchas personas son cajeros y si los roban quien paga? El banco? El dueño de ese banco? No sale de sus pagas y si mueren y tienen familia ?
3005,"Parce los dueños de grandes empresas, bancos, etc tienen la capacidad, medios y dinero para sencillamente cerrar, largarse y abrir en otro lad, lo hemos visto suceder muchas veces, por eso mismo no entiendo por que atacan negocios pequeños y medianos. Son gente que talvez no puedan recuperarse, mucho menos bajo las condiciones actuales, protestar está bien, vandalismo no, mucho menos a pequeños y medianos negocios."
3006,Porqué esta historia suena a historia falsa para dar lástima? 🤔
3007,"A ver le cuento: en Cali el año pasado quemaron dos bancos ; 1 ya lo abrieron después de como dos meses , el otro aún no lo abren porque pues lo destruyeron todo. Los que trabajaban en ese se quedaron sin empleo. Lo sé porque la cuñada de una amiga trabajaba allí y no pudieron ubicarla en otra sucursal. Una familia que quedó sin ingresos ."
3008,"Los pequeños locales están siendo atacados por la pomicia. El transporte público es tan caro que una persona trabajadora no se puede montar. De nuevo, esos daños los hace la policía, y si usted cree que soy un vandalo por decirle a la cara que un gobierno entero lo convence a usted que las protestas están mal usando a agentes de la fuerza pública, pues si soy un vandalo, mientras que usted solo se sienta dejando que que el país se venga abajo por su propia condesencia. Retirese."
3009,"Esos buses, aparte de que son un sistema fallido, son de un operador privado. Eso lo paga una aseguradora privada."
3010,"Bueno y los robaron? Hay denuncias? Les hicieron algo. Cagada el miedo a morir, pero esto es Colombia. Vivir con miedo es lo que nos toca a todos. Da tristeza pero es así."
3011,"Sí, los negocios pequeños y los bienes públicos deben ser protegidos.

pero deje la fantasía. Los bancos jamás se van a ir de Colombia. Tienen uno de los margenes de intermediacion más altos del mundo. Al nivel de Africa. Será que van a soltar esa tetica tan deliciosa que somos los colombianos, que hasta en una pandemia nos arrodillamos para rescatarlos a ellos de primeros.

Me puede decir cuáles son las muchas veces en que se ha visto eso suceder, por favor?"
3012,[deleted]
3013,"Los vándalos siempre han existido, no es como que se generan mágicamente cada protesta y después de la protesta desaparecen, o usted cree que el término ""Vandalismo"" es exclusivo para las protestas?, pueden haber policías vandalizando, como también gente a la  que les gusta destruir cosas, lo llame vándalo por concluir que voy en contra de la protesta porque no apoyo el Vandalismo, además ese argumento de que ""los buses son muy caros y no se pueden montar la gente trabajadora"" entonces por eso esta bien destruirlos?





Nadie cree que las protestas están mal, lo que está mal es el Vandalismo"
3014,[deleted]
3015,"Eso mismo decían los Venezolanos que no se irían, que no sucedería, ya sabemos el resto...y si vamos por lo que dice no se va el banco como tal, pero sus dueños si y los fregados seguimos siendo nosotros, pa lo que les importa, mientras que pequeño negocios son los negocios de la gente que uno conoce, amigos de uno, familiares que se han esforzado para tener lo que tienen, eso que hicieron no fue más que vandalismo y la embarraron, todo comenzó bien hasta que comenzaron con eso."
3016,“Conocido” tiene 170.000 seguidores 😅
3017,"Todos esos SITM son el gran robo del uribismo. El operador se queda con el 95% de las ganancias y la ciudad con 5%, pero la ciudad construye las vias y las estaciones. El robo del siglo. Que ardan. Por algo en todas las ciudades los SITM los entregaron a medias, llenos de elefantes blancos, estan quebrados, dan pesimo servicio etc, son monumentos a la corrupcion."
3018,"Listo, no fue capaz de dar un ejemplo y ya nombró a los venezolanos. No voy a seguir debatiendo porque estamos hablando de Colombia y usted unicamente está siendo emocional sin brindar fuentes o datos concretos."
3019,[deleted]
3020,"Como que no, mire no mas nuestro propio país, no contemos 2020 por la pandemia, pero en el 2019 cuantas multinacionales se fueron? Phillip Morris, Mars, krispy creme, etc, lo mismo los dueños de negocios nacionales, cierra y se van a vivir a Estados Unidos, Canadá, Europa, etc y eso son las grandes empresas, ahora dañar negocios pequeños que talvez no tengan chance de recuperación? De nuevo protestar esta bien, vandalismo no."
3021,"Pues ese hecho en particular no. Pero ese hecho no es un sintoma, es una consecuencia. La gente está harta de andar en esos sistemas BRT caros, contaminantes, corruptos etc. Entonces quemarlos es simbolico. Para eso sirve. Como han servido todas las manifestaciones ciudadanas violentas. O usted cree que en algun país las cosas cambiaron con besatones y chocolatones? Encima en colombia las cosas se arreglan así. Las elites nos arreglan asi, con ejercitos legales, ilegales y burocraticos. Es el momento de hacernos sentir. Me da un poco de cagada con J pantano pero que coman mierda los dueños de esos buses en serio."
3022,Aja. Y cuántos bancos se han ido de Colombia?
3023,"No soy de Colombia pero estoy muy interesado en esto.  ¿Alguien sabe de un sitio donde pueda seguir este tema, la política colombiana y tal?

muy interesado en escuchar el resultado de esta protesta."
3024,"Tienes razon con esto fijo van a ""nesecitar"" mas fondos para reparar todo. Y luego hay que ver como se van a dispara los casos y se llenan las ucis, para luego verlos peleando por lo de la sanidad. Que círculo visioso mas hijueputa."
3025,"Este post es la perfecta muestra de que en Colombia no va a cambiar nada, mucho menos por la que quizá sea la única via posible: las protestas.

Aquí la gente se comió el cuento de que la protesta debe ser súper pacífica, serena, calladita, por el andén, pidan permiso, sólo pueden protestar de X a Y hora y no hagan mucho ruido porque qué molestia. Hasta salen a hacer rídculos como bailecitos, cantar canciones y llenar la protesta de memes porque ""hombre, es que esas no son maneras"".

Es que, en serio, imaginate a Duque y Carrasquilla súper preocupadisimos porque salieron a hacer una marchita por el andén y llegaron a un parque a hacer sancocho. ¡QUE SUSTO TAN TENAZ DE POR DIOS! Yo no sé cómo es que los franceses lograron los [acuerdos de Grenelle en el 68](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp-VXKQuQig) casi que acabando con París, cuando acá tenemos la mejor fórmula: Besatones, chocolatadas y ""no me tumbe el poste hermano, que esas no son formas""

Definitivamente, no hay ser más subdesarrollado, perdidamente cobarde e incorregiblemente sumiso que un Colombiano.  


>Si tanto estudian, actúen con inteligencia, tumbar un poste lo hace cualquier gamín

Ay por dios..."
3026,"Es un mal necesario para llamar la atención del ejecutivo y producir cambios. Una protesta sin tensión social es totalmente ignorada. Cuantas marchas no hemos tenido sin cambios? Cuantas veces no se ha marchado en Colombia y simplemente las cosas no cambian?

Es cierto que destruir bienes públicos es falto de toda logica. Pero recuerde que gran parte de los activos del estado y de los bancos estan asegurados por pólizas que cubren estos riesgos. No digo que por eso sea inteligente destruir todo (las primas de los seguros aumentan a mayor el riesgo) pero no es tampoco cierto que al pobre gobierno le toque quebrarse para pagar eso."
3027,"El país no evolucionará hasta que ""los buenos"" no hagan lo propio. No puede ser que sigan con los mismos métodos violentos de hace 30 años para manifestar desacuerdo con un gobierno tan débil como el de Duque"
3028,"Digale eso a los ñeros y a los locos de la calle,me dejaron con las ventanas rotas y las rejas todas dañadas solo porque la policia llego a un supermercado que estaban saqueando y se empezaron a pedrear, y si asi esta cali no me imagino por otros lados, y casi se me meten a la casa por defenderme y me pedrearon el cuarto de mis hermanas, sinceramente ya no le veo esperanza de mejora a colombia y pienso mudarme de aqui lo mas pronto posible antes de que me pase algo peor."
3029,"Usted de que habla de la plata que nos cuesta la protesta cuando nos van a clavar la tributaria a punta de billones ahi esta lo grave. Hablando de centavos cuando nos sacan millones por atras, prioridades porfavor."
3030,DÍA DE BRUTOS !
3031,"Pues mira, la pandemia ha sido devastadora con los más pobres. En este momento de crisis económica, las fotos multas no han bajado de precio. No hay ayudas del gobiernos. Los pequeños negocios quebrados o apenas sobreviviendo.
La gente aquí está MAMADA de la mala gestión del gobierno, de ver cómo los políticos se roban la ata de frente mientras las personas que viven al día de vender cosas en los semáforos o en las calles aguantan hambre por los toques de queda.
Es natural que la rabia general estalle. Antes de juzgar este tipo de cosas, te invito a ver qué tan privilegiado estás, para juzgar a quienes están sobreviviendo son migajas diarias"
3032,"Si les interesa tanto el dinero, tengan en cuenta que destruyendo la ciudad al menos toca meter plata para algo real, en vez de que se los roben.

Unos vidrios no cuestan un subidón de impuestos, no sean tan tontitos."

3043,"Total. Un poste de esos cuesta 50 mil pesos en material, pero “es que nos los van a cobrar en los impuestos” mientras están marchando para que eso no pase. Pero se cayó el puente Chirajara en la vía al Llano, 3 billones de pesos y creo que como 15 muertos, pero es que esas no son formas.

Ellos nos roban, dan la orden que disparen y gaseen... pero esas no son formas.

No hay mayores acomodados que los antiuribistas rolos que creen que con besatones se gana algo mientras en otras partes del país matan a orden de nuestros honorables parlamentarios.

Le tienen mas miedo a ser “gamines” que a ser robados, esclavizados y humillados por toda vida.

Irónicamente tontos. No le echan cinco minutos de cabeza a la vaina."
3044,"Sigan destruyendo, la única opción!"
3045,Oigan a este erudito diciendo que el gobierno de duque es débil?? En USA pasa lo mismo entonces ellos tampoco han evolucionado ??? LA GENTE SE CANSO Y LA FOTO MULTA ES UNA FORMA DE QUITARLE DINERO AL PUEBLO DE FORMA INJUSTA.
3046,"Creo que por algún motivo, hoy Cali fue donde más pesada estuvo la cosa. Pero sí, total."

Si la situación se sale de control, retírese del lugar, en las manifestaciones violentas los que pagan el ""pato"" son los menos experimentados o los curiosos."

3065,"Edit: Lo siento, creí que buscabas ""tips"" y consejos xd. En cualquier caso dejo el comentario por si a alguien le sirve.

Definitivamente lleva agua con bicarbonato de sodio, es un muy buen neutralizante para el gas lacrimógeno que tiran fuera de las universidades (dentro de estas tiran uno muchísimo más fuerte y el bicarbonato casi no sirve). Comprate uno o dos sobrecitos y revuelvelos en una botella de agua; si te empieza a picar la nariz/ojos, aplica en la cara y eso te va a aliviar bastante. Si ves a alguien que está sufriendo por el gas, ofrecele neutralizante, enserio que andar por ahí con esa mierda es muy fastidioso, y les va a salvar de pasar un rato malo. NO apliques agua potable en la cara, solo empeora la picazón.

Si planeas grabar casos de abuso policial o similares, NO uses desbloqueo biométrico (huella o facial) de celular, sino una contraseña, así no lo van a poder desbloqueae facilmente y eliminar la evidencia. Si quieres grabar capuchos o gente así, evita grabarles la cara, ya que suelen ser algo pesados con eso.

Ten cuidado con el celular, muchos malandros aprovechan la acumulación de personas para ver que se pueden robar de los bolsillos de otros. 

De ser posible, lleva una pila extra, o esas pilas portables, o al menos un cargador; estar incomunicado con tus amigos/conocidos/familiares cuando todo se pone denso es una situación que debes evitar.

Lleva líquido para hidratarte, las caminatas suelen ser largas :'v

Lleva sombrilla. A veces hace muuucho sol o se pone a llover, y esta ayuda bastante. Definitivamenre vale la pena la molestia de tener que cargarla.

Si estás en Bogotá, lleva la tarjeta del SITP, así sin importar a donde termines dando a parar, cuando ya te vayas a retirar y volver a tu casita, vas a poder hacerlo con facilidad (el mapa del celular o preguntarle a personas que atienden negocios también ayuda).

En caso de que la cosa se llegue a poner muy muy turbia y estés muy en medio del caos, no te asustes por las aturdidoras y empieces a correr a lo loco a atropellar a todo el mundo, estas no hacen realmente nada, solo es el ruido. Respecto a los granadas de gas, los del ESMAD inicialmente las tiran como ""rodando"" por el piso, y luego las tiran en forma de tiro parabolico, asi que mira hacia arriba y evita que te golpee una de estas (un casco también puede ayudar). Mucho cuidado con tu cabeza, si una de estas cosas te golpea en la cabeza, va a ocacionar muchisimo daño, llegando a incluso ser letal. NO las patees ni las cogas con la mano, suelen estar *muy* calientes, y patearlas solo es buscar hacerle daño a alguien más que está corriendo por ahí.

Del resto te diría que te calmes un poco, no es tan malo como uno cree o ve por ahí. En realidad el 95% del tiempo es casi como una ""fiesta"" en cierto sentido cultural. Cuando se pone denso, si estás lejos del epicentro (>100m), lo peor que vas a pasar es la molestia del gas, cosa que el agua con bicarbonato quita. En cualquier caso, trata de estar atento de tu alrededor, ya que los policias a veces tratan de acorralar a las personas asi no hagan nada malo.

Por último, enserio lleva agua con bicarbonato.

Cualquier duda me avisas"

3167,"Customer service is not a focus of most businesses here. The excuse is typically cost related, but with limited competition, it's just not a motivating factor. The hassle to open an account at a different bank, plus the restrictions on new accounts, makes existing customers stay. And it's not like the next bank will be any better. Same goes for telecom. Three real providers here, so as long as one isn't significantly worse than the others, none will lose a large number of customers. 

The general Colombian market is heavily focused on price point. I have taught my girlfriend to look at price per gram or price per unit in the grocery store. She's shocked every time she finds a product she used to buy because the total price is lower, but the price per gram/unit is higher than a similar product of a larger pack size. In turn, she's also found that buying a higher quality product (beans for example) results in less waste from throwing out damaged product, plus time saved, so sometimes it's worth it to buy higher quality.

It frustrated me when I first came here, but I have a vehicle, so I've found the locations that have less of a line/wait. For ATM's, I've found the grocery stores with one connected tend to not have a line. I don't have a cédula yet, so entering a bank isn't a problem yet. For cell services, see if you're provider allows you to schedule an appointment online. At least that way you skip the line outside.

In my opinion, the issues in Colombia are nothing compared to the beauty, people and culture. I came from a very far paced, high stress life in the US, and I've decided to let it go and live on ""island time"". It's worked out well so far."
3168,"La burocracia colombiana puede ser muy frustrate. Siempre que voy al banco tengo que armarme de paciencia. Toma muchísimo tiempo y la gente no siempre quiere ayudar. Un servicio terrible, como dices tú.

3169,"If you just wanna take money out with a US debit card, look for Servibanca. There are almost never any lines there, and they let you take out up to a million at a time if you need it."
3170,"Thanks for the detailed response.  I understand that you can't really switch companies to get better service because of lack of choice unfortunately.  But I'm legitimately curious how people hold down a job when these services demand so much time and are only open during the work day. Colombian employers don't seem extra generous with benefits/pay from what I've heard.  Making an appointment doesn't seem like a common option here. Just wondering how people could move apartments or buy a house or something that would require interacting with multiple services without taking a week off of work. 

&#x200B;

I agree that there are many benefits to living here that outweigh this one negative, just was curious about it.  I do appreciate not everyone here being overly concerned about time and efficiency, the US lifestyle is not very empathetic or forgiving and stresses me out too."
3171,"They ask for time off and don't get paid for it. We give up to a half day off without reducing pay for personal issues, but that isn't common. Some employers, especially in agriculture, are absolute tyrants. Many people will have a family member handle it for them. If you think it's bad in the cities, imagine living in a rural community, and having a half day walk, or bus ride that costs about 15% of a days pay to even get to where the service you need is offered."

Creo que el descontrol con alguno de los que protestaban les paso factura. Aunque duque tambien de cierta forma destruyo su partido.
3194,"Me parece que la política de no negociar  por parte del gobierno ha cumplido su propósito, echar por tierra las buenas intenciones de la protesta, si a ello se le suma un comité de paro que no representa a nadie y un montón de revueltas que solo trasmiten desorden y  dejan vandalismo,  podemos decir que estamos igual que al principio o peor. Sí fuera necesario decir quién ganó y quien perdió, tal vez diría que ganó el gobierno, porque la popularidad de sus detractores está por el piso, sin seder mayor cosa, perdió la protesta porque no consigo mayor cosa, y sí dejo múltiples daños que afectan al pueblo, otro perdedor,  mismo que ahora aborrece la protesta esa misma de la que podría mayor beneficio."
3195,"The results are interesting to follow over time. I think the margin of error for cities outside Bogotá is a bit high at around +-7% for a 95% interval of confidence (it reached almost 10% for the May 18-22 poll). Also, I've always thought they give too much weight to landline polling compared to cellphone polling (almost 2 to 1, a bit less in Bogotá which perhaps may explain the slightly lower margin of error). They explain that they do random simple selection of respondents within homes - the ones who pick up the calls. Now, what are the kind of people that are there to pick a landline call to answer a survey during the day? I believe there is a hidden skew here to consider. 

Putting that aside, I think that people in general right now are disgusted with politics and politians overall. How will that play out during next year's elections? It's too early too know. Nobody came out unscathed of the protests: Claudia López, Fajardo, Peñalosa, Uribe, Duque, the government-dominated Congress and the rest of government institutions. 

What's important in these surveys is to identify tendencies, most rebounds are well within the margins of error. For instance, you can see in the graphic clear waning of Uribe's favorable image over time. That in itself is significant but paired with the idea that people are not willing to sacrifice their freedoms for more security, a historic gap in recent disfavorability/unvorability of the police forces, and an increase in the unfavorability of the armed forces, it seems to me that the Seguridad Democrática doctrine might be slowly dying and that is good for Colombia in the long run, regardless what the election results might be in the short-run. 

Duque's approval/disapproval gap is still abismal. It caught my attention that La Silla Vacía's analysis on his numbers is misleading:

>Después de ese 18 por ciento, al que llegó antes del paro, con el debate de la tributaria, el presidente vuelve a tener el favor de casi un tercio de los encuestados. 

23% approval rate is not even a fourth of the interviewees, much less a third. There's no need to hype him like this. What La Silla Vacía didn't say is that 84% of Colombians believe that things are getting worse - 3% more than in May - which was the toughest month of the strike. Just 10% of the people think that the country is going well and this falls mainly upon the shoulders of the government. I have no doubts that the actions of the government-controlled Congress - whose favorability is in lows not seen since 1994 - affects its overall image, and Fiscalía, Procuraduría, Contraloría and Corte Suprema de Justicia all show worse favorability numbers.

The strike was never going to reach significant reforms of any kind - because of protests' devaluation as a mechanism to achieve true political change and this goverment's own willingness to rectify its course due to popular demand - but it certainly shook things up. It will be fun to see what happens in the months to come."
3196,Donde hicieron esa encuesta en el chico? o en los rosales?
3197,"Esos no es que estén muy bien de popularidad... Además, con gobierno demócrata en El Norte, no hay chance (afortunadamente)."
3198,"Ojalá lo dieran. La única manera de salvar a Colombia es reconstruyendo desde las cenizas. Las instituciones democráticas están corruptas desde la raíz, cortar las ramas no cambiará nada."
3199,"Si, hay algo que muchos no han entendido, si bien Duque es impopular no lo es por falta de medidas zurdas, sino por falta de medidas conservadoras (que fue el sector que lo eligió) en esa medida el será cada vez mas  impopular pero en pro de quien se presente mas conservador y con un discurso que apele mas a la seguridad y el orden.

Muchas personas quieren evitar el desorden de la izquierda y ven a Duque exageradamente blando, lo que afecta su imagen, pero no por las razones que la gente de izquierda creen.

La mayoría de la gente del común solo quiere un poco de mano dura para que sus vidas y sus trabajos vuelvan a la normalidad sin afectaciones.

En tanto se sigan dando estos exabruptos, si bien Duque seguiría mermando, no sería para dar ventaja a la izquierda sino para dejar abierto el nicho a quien se presente con el discurso mas centrado desde el punto de vista conservador.

Muchos celebraban que Colombia había ""despertado"" y no se dieron cuenta que lo que despertaron fue los conservadores que ya se estaban empezando a ir a dormir.

Ahora mismo cada bobada que cometa o Duque o el Alcalde de Calí o el alcalde zurdo de cualquier ciudad importante solo va mejorar la imagen de Cabal y ya quiero ver las estadísticas nuevas de los precandidatos van a estar muy divertidas ya que si bien Petro se presentaba fuerte antes del paro, el ""no sabe no responde"" y el ""voto en blanco"" siguen siendo mas fuertes en los últimos reportes, y creo que ese resultado se va empezar a distribuir hacia la nueva candidata conservadora.

Yo en lo personal que NUNCA he votado a ningún candidato del uribismo, NUNCA, tengo claro en este momento que si la segunda vuelta se da entre Petro y Cabal, me veré en la incomoda necesidad de votar por Cabal ya que me quedó claro que a Petro le interesan estos exabruptos y no le importa el desabastecimiento.

Muy dificil que yo vuelva a votar por Petro nunca mas en la vida."
3200,"La popularidad del gobierno también está por el piso, en este mismo artículo lo expresan:

3206,Las instituciones de la Constitución de Petrosky?
3207,La situacion de Colombia se me hace muy preocupante. Estamos ante 2 candidatos terribles que ponen en riesgo al pais. Yo espero que los Colombianos voten por alguien moderado que no vuelva este pais un desastre y nos de algo de calma por un tiempo mientras salen mejores candidatos.
3208,">Si, hay algo que muchos no han entendido, si bien Duque es impopular no lo es por falta de medidas zurdas, sino por falta de medidas conservadoras (que fue el sector que lo eligió) en esa medida el será cada vez mas  impopular pero en pro de quien se presente mas conservador y con un discurso que apele mas a la seguridad y el orden.

Y como se explica entonces la creciente impopularidad de Uribe, quien siempre ha sido representante de la ""mano dura""?"
3209,"Sí, pero su interés primordial al no negociar es cuidar la imagen del partido frente a las próximas elecciones."
3210,"Parcero, usted tiene un trauma muy grande con Petro, ¿ha ido al psicólogo? Porque veo que lo preda hasta en el caldo del desayuno."
3211,"Yo creo que si Fajardo llega a segunda vuelta podría ganar, o alguien como el, yo votaría por el, de lo contrario ya decidí que votaré lo mas a la derecha que haya, asi me toque votar por Cabal."
3212,"Vamos a ver Uribe es una figura muy personalista. En algún momento dejará de ser un mesias, eso no significa que la gente vaya a dejar de ser conservadora. Hasta Churchill envejeció mal en su segundo mandato y fue bastante impopular.

La crisis de liderazgo se va resolver con liderazgo. A Uribe la izquierda lo suele sobredimensionar, cuando el solo representó la amalgama de todos los sectores politicos algunos dispares entre si en un momento de terrorismo sin precedentes, sin duda en la actualidad la situación está lejisimos de lo que era en el momento en que Uribe era una gran opción, pero no significa que ante el desorden producido por la izquierda el trabajador no vaya a desear orden..

Uribe no es una teoría económica o social, y su movimiento tampoco es un partido de algún purismo ideológico, tanto es así que hasta tienen ex guerrilleros en sus filas. Hay una nueva generación, gente que ni siquiera vivió el gobierno de Uribe que no por ello hoy tienen que ser personas de ""izquierda"", ""derecha"" o conservadores.

Uribe llegó a la presidencia después de 2 políticos bastante diferentes de el y Samper y Pastrana, Pastrana que era bastante parecido a Duque y Samper que era un zurdo de cabo a rabo, en ese momento la gente se cansó del desorden y el terrorismo y renuncó a las singularidades politicas en pro de un ""guerrero"" que trajera el triunfo.

Hoy en día no tenemos carros bomba o pescas milagrosas, Uribe ha envejecido, pero el desorden exige un poco de mano dura aunque esta mano dura no tenga la misma intensidad que en el 2000, pues hay que recordar que en el 2000 ir por la calle representaba un terrible peligro de morir en un atentado terrorista facilmente (a mi me tocarón como 3 o 4 ataques terroristas en diferentes momentos de mi vida)

Hoy no se da ese peligro, asi que es aceptable que ya no se necesite un discurso tan extremo como el de Uribe, pero el orden sigue siendo prioritario, ya no se necesita un guerrero, pero se necesita firmeza."
3213,Esta es la clase de gente que cree que todos los problemas de Colombia son culpa de Petro.
3214,"Resulta que las hordas petristas pasan por mi apartamento todos los días, molestando mi tranquilidad, aumentando el expendio de drogas y el hurto en la zona. Así que si: mi disminución en la calidad de vida en los últimos días obedece a que el cocainómano corrupto ojibrotao ese le dio por sacar a sus seguidores a la calle.

3215,"Con tal de Colombia desarrolle un buen libre mercado, oportunidades para todos y muchas cosas positivas para la nación, sería un aporte  😳"
3216,"1. Si usted cree que Petro dirige el Paro se equivoca enormemente. 


2. Comprendo lo molesto que puede llegar a ser el ruido, pero vea usted que es preferible oír a la gente en protesta que oír los disparos que les matan impunemente. 


3. No sé si Petro sea Cocainomano, cada quién su nariz, pero decir que el aumento de expendio de drogas es culpa de los manifestantes es error, obviamente es algo que, al igual que el covid, venía a la alza desde antes del paro.


4. Y si por consumo de ""drogas"" se refiere a la Mariguana, pos, ahí sí se puede ser menos objetivo. Yo, en lo personal, no lo considero una droga como tal. Pero pues, cada quién su pensar respecto a eso.



Edit: ¿pero sí lo ve en el caldo del desayuno o en el almuerzo? XD"

3219,No es sino que cruce la fecha de la orden y los desmanes precisamente en Bogotá. Que el ojibrotao haya fracasado con su convocatoria no significa que los desmanes no sean su responsabilidad.
3220,Es lógico que estas cosas ocurran en un pais donde el estado hace rato fue cooptado por una mafia narco paramilitar que utiliza el erario para enriquecerse.
3221,"Los estudiantes estaban protestando por una mensualidad y matrícula más económicas, y a su vez exigiendo nueva infraestructura escolar, y mejores condiciones educativas.

Solución: incinerar toda la escuela e impedir que incluso los niños que si quieren estudiar (la mayoria) puedan hacerlo. Y quedarse sin asistir a clase indefinidamente, win-win. 

Afortunadamente son niños, ningún adulto en su sano juicio pensaría de esa manera, Oh wait... 👀"

3232,entonces toca dejar que los maten según?
3233,"De mi parte, no me atrevo a hacer futurología ni a emitir calificativos sin argumentos comprobables. Lo que se ha visto, por las declaraciones que han salido en la prensa y en las redes sociales, es que hay muchas y muy distintas razones por las que los manifestantes se hn movilizado en Colombia , pues así está ocurriendo en el mundo entero, donde las ciudadanías se quejan de que los politicos no atienden las necesidades de las mayorías, sino las de las élites. Aquí tenemos un gobierno favoreciendo principalmente a la élite de su partido; ni siquiera gobierna a favor de todos los que votaron por el candidato de ese partido, ni para la oposición (lo que aqui se tiene como lógico) ni mucho menos lo hace para favorecer a los que no votaron. Se aprovechan y hace caso omiso a que Duque es el presidente de todos los colombianos y eso es lo que sacó a la gente a las calles. Es absurdo pensar que Petro tiene tal capacidad de movilización, aunque con el tiempo están llevando a esos jóvenes que no tienen posición política definida a unirse a Petro porque ven que sabido interpretar sus motivaciones y necesidades."
3234,"Y quien mierda los puso de lideres del paro?
Hasta donde se, el paro es apolitico."
3235,"El glifosato o los productos que lo contienen son cancerígenos. 

Varios estudios científicos independientes (es decir, no financiados por Monsanto-Bayer u otras empresas agroalimentarias) han confirmado que el glifosato no sólo es peligroso para el medio ambiente, sino también para la salud humana.

Así que lo que me has mostrado es pura propaganda.

Además, me gustaría añadir que la deforestación no sólo está causada por el cultivo de coca; la deforestación también puede estar causada por el cultivo de soja y otros productos básicos."
3236,"No, el paro no es apolítico. No puede serlo cuando aquello que motiva el paro es consecuencia directa de las políticas que han regido hasta ahora. El paro es una expresión de inconformismo político. Algunos de esos líderes son los jefes de cada sindicato. Quienes no nos vemos representantafos en ellos debemos construir mecanismos de representación o diálogo, también."
3237,"Esa es una excelente pregunta, esos manes son sindicalistas hace años, y viven del paro, mientras unos pasan hambre y se matan con la policia ellos ganan plata 🤷‍♀️"
3238,"está todo indexado como para hablar de propaganda, además la deforestación acá es por coca, minería ilegal y en menor medida ganaderos o sembradores de palma, acá no hay plantaciones de soya (al menos del nivel de argentina o brasil)."
3239,"El tema es que el sindicato solo busca beneficio propio y las personas que buscan realmente el beneficio colectivo, han perdido el rumbo, es más se perdió el rumbo directamente de su origen, ""unión de ciudadanos para la defensa de los derechos civiles"".

Se volvio un tema de palanca, que un tema de unión ciudadana desde para ser veedores de los procesos públicos y vulneración de derechos.

Son visto como políticos, no como la representación de la clase obrera o popular del país, estoy seguro que muchas personas que están en el sindicato, son personas que realmente abogan por lo que la gente necesita, pero hay mucha gente, sobretodo los de arriba, que representan el egoísmo humano y de este país.

Ojala en Colombia se observaran las uniones laborales que se ven en Alemania o en Europa."
3240,"La verdad es que la fuente que usted subio es muy poco seria, a diferencia de la respuesta que le dieron, muy bien sustentada con ciencia.

A fin de cuentas la coca son 200,000 hectareas maximo. Cuántas hectareas se deforestan por ganaderia en el país si estamos hablando de al menos 50 millones de cabezas de ganado?"
3241,"La puse porque precisamente porque tiene una serie de links que redireccionan a las páginas donde están los estudios que están indexadas en lugares serios, si quiere mañana me pongo y le copio y le pego cada link (que era lo que quería evitar poniendo el link inicial).

Si son más o son menos no viene al comentario inicial en el que decía que el glifosato me parece menos perjudicial que esperar a que sigan deforestando; obvio es un problema la ganadería, el cultivo de palma entre otras cosas como lo mencione también pero ese no era el tema."
3242,"Siempre he sostenido que en Colombia la gente no sabe de protestas, estamos acostumbrados a agachar la cabeza. La protesta se hace por un corto tiempo y luego quiere que la dejen trabajar, aunque este sufriendo fuentes necesidades. A eso juega el gobierno a que la misma gente, por agotamiento deslegitime la protesta, y pase de ser el verdugo al salvador que restableció el orden  Tal vez en momento determinado se reavive, pero si el colombiano de a pie no entiende que están son cosas de largo aliento y de fuerte inversión no conseguirá nada y seguimos en la situación que estamos. Mi única esperanza es que está situación le pase factura en las urnas a la clase política que nos tiene en las que estamos."
3243,"La pregunta del millón es: Que legitimidad, quien representan los líderes del paro que están a la mesa de negociación.
Sin legitimidad popular no pueden llegar a nada. Duque hace ""damage control"" y no va a negociar nada con gente que no representan a nadie mas que ellos mismos. 
Los que manifestaron contra la reforma tributaria, el verdadero pueblo colombiano no afiliado, hace rato regresó a casa."
3244,"Creo que se lograron muchas cosas que era imposible que sucedieran con este gobierno tan descarado:

1. Replantamiento de la reforma tributaria. Se sabe que el texto original genera descontento social así que les toca pensar bien el nuevo texto que todo el mundo va a estar encima vigilando.
2. Renunció el ministro de hacienda, el viceministro general de hacienda, el alto comisionado para la paz.
3. Matrícula gratuita en el semestre 2021-2 para estratos 1 a 3 (no es mucho pero es algo).
4. Reforma  a la estructura de la policía nacional, el ministerio de defensa, y la estupidez del cambio de color de uniformes y patrullas.
5. La concientización de mucha gente respecto a la necesidad de la educación y vigilancia de la fuerza pública en derechos humanos, que antes no era tema de conversación.
6. El desanmascaramiento del gobierno actual a nivel local e internacional como represor y violador de derechos humanos.
7. Más del 70% de los colombianos apoyó en cierta medida el paro (Mobimetrics), lo que evidencia el despertar social y político de las mayorías, y se naturaliza el exigir al gobierno cumplir un estándar mayor.
8. El fortalecimiento de los grupos políticos de oposición, dada su evidente influencia, que a su vez motivó a poderosos sectores empresariales a preguntarse si apoyar la campaña de los de siempre era necesario.
9. El retiro de algunas armas exesivas en el ESMAD.

Obviamente seguirá la mamadera de gallo, toca esperar hasta las próximas elecciones, quizá el descontento social se sienta en las urnas también, esperaría uno la reducción del ausentismo."
3245,"La verdad no lo veo como fracaso porque no nos dejamos meter las reformas. Carrasquilla renunció y la comunidad internacional se enteró cómo son realmente los que nos gobiernan. Nuestra situación es muy compleja y no podemos pretender cambiar todo en un par de semanas, eso es imposible!  Tenemos que seguir día a día integrando los cambios que queremos ver en nuestra cotidianidad eliminando lo que tanto criticamos en nuestros políticos. Por ejemplo, si estamos cansados de la corrupción, entonces dejemos de sobornar a policías o agentes de tránsito para evitar multas. Si queremos fortalecer nuestra economía, entonces apoyemos a los campesinos y emprendimientos locales. Hay que dejar de vender el voto por un tamal o peor aún, seguir en abstinencia electoral. Hay que dejar de ver los canales que desinforman y manipulan. Hay que revisar cómo sembramos violencia desde nuestras propias acciones y tratar de cambiar eso. Lo que vemos afuera no es más que un  eco de lo que nosotros hacemos."
3246,[removed]
3247,"No consideró que fracasó, todavía hay manifestaciones en varias ciudades, hay encuentros ciudadanos y otras maneras de resistir. No fracasó, la gente se está organizando, se reconoce que la acción de salir a la calle no es suficiente, se están haciendo asambleas, se están creando organizaciones, hay más espacios de diálogo y de educación, hay más voluntad política de la gente, de conocer cómo puedo yo aportar,  qué mecanismos de participación existe, la política no es solo salir a votar y esperar  que los otros hagan, necesitamos que nos involucremos, en el territorio donde habitemos, que seguramente hay muchas problemáticas, bueno desde ahí, empezar, cómo hago una veeduría, cómo hacer una auditoría, qué contratos  se están haciendo, qué políticos no han pasado proyectos, esto es de largo aliento. Me siento muy orgullosa porque el paro sirvió para reconocer que somos muchos los que nos interesa hacia dónde va el país y nuestro futuro. Es el paro más largo qué he visto en mis años."
3248,"El fracaso más grande del paro fue que a sus impulsores Petro y demás líderes lo hicieron con fines políticos, pero ahora que por causa del paro están muriendo cientos de personas, petro tiene miedo que afecte sus aspiraciones electorales."
3249,"La falta de organizacion y exigencias poco realistas para lo que vive Colombia en el momento dan muestra del fracaso del Paro. Me parecio un atentado contra la juventud lo que ha hecho el tal ""comite del paro"" al apropiarse de las manifestaciones y sacar provecho politico con el dolor de los jovenes. Por otra parte, me duele en el corazon calificar a los de la primera linea como ""idiotas utiles,"" pues no fueron tomados en cuenta para las negociaciones, y ellos eran los que ponian la cara. Finalmente, esta forma de protestar, solo dio pie para que gobierno y otros grupos deslegitimizaran la protesta como mecanismo democratico, pues algo que debio ser un llamado a escuchar el pueblo, termino siendo recordado como bloqueos, exceso de fuerza y actos vandalicos.

Edit: como comentario final...Espero y aspiro que este descontento generalizado se vea reflejado en las elecciondes de congreso, senado y presidencia del 2022."
3250,"El paro falló porque al gobierno no le importa los derechos humanos. 

Cuando las mercancías se encuentran estancadas por razones de logística a causa de los paros y bloqueos viales, ese problema es de los ciudadanos causado por los ciudadanos.

El fallo ahí está en el hecho que el paro no afecta al gobierno si no al ciudadano, especialmente al ciudadano de bajos recursos que no representa ninguna amenaza social a la élite del país, o sea los ricos. El gobierno no se responsabiliza de nada, ni en el pasado ni ahora.

La comunidad internacional no se mete, los estados unidos nos meten plata en el bolsillo y la desgracia democrática continúa gracias al lavado de cerebro tan hijueputa que nos han hecho."
3251,"No la clase política no hace que se sienta frustrado eso uno lo hace solito,protestar protestar creo que debería uno protestar contra si mismo sus malas desiciones,su flojera,pero es más sencillo psicológicamente que otro tenga la culpa no yo,de lo que me pasa,Gente hay Covid cuídense y a sus familias, suben los casos por las aglutinamientos de gente de las protestas."
3252,"Totalmente de acuerdo,las reformas ya se callejón,me tomé la libertad de leer lo que pide el comité del paro,y están grande pide alrededor de 132 cosas,que tomarían 5 reformas tributarias para hacerlas,ya que el problema de fondo es que no hay plata."
3253,"No caigas en el mismo error que el gobierno.  Para el gobierno el paro no es legítimo ya y solo lo ve como producto de la intervención de Venezuela/Rusia 🙄 o el llamado electoral de Petro o gente pagada por los narcos, bacrim o guerrilla. Con esta justificación el gobierno hace oídos sordos y cierra la puerta al diálogo. Con esto el gobierno no ve qué los jóvenes que sigue en las calles lo hacen porque siguen teniendo peticiones legítimas. Los jóvenes quedan sin ser escuchados y esto genera más frustración.

El comité del paro no representa a todos los sectores. Eso es bien conocido e incluso lo han dicho ellos. Es responsabilidad del gobierno buscar canales de comunicación con los demás sectores, y si estos no tienen líderes claros, pues es también tarea del gobierno dar espacios y garantizar que estos liderazgos surjan. Por qué es responsabilidad del gobierno? Porque sencillamente para eso es la política."
3254,"Pese a que no estoy de acuerdo con muchos puntos del paro, debo reconocer que estos en particular si los veo como logros...solo espero que en serio la solucion que salga de todo esta sea lo mejor para el pais"
3255,"Tienes razon que se han logrado cosas compañero, pero el problema ahora sera ver que si se cumplan algunas de esas cosas que se han logrado o que el apoyo (o union nacional) se mantenga. Por poner un ejemplo de cosas que se dijeron para calmar los animos pero al final no se estan cumpliendo: la matricula cero para este 2021 al final se ha hundido en el congreso, asi que la promesa hecha por el gobierno con la cual tanto se ha dicho ""estamos escuchando al pueblo y ayudandolos en este tiempo de necesidad "" al final ha sido algo que han tumbado los mismos que son mas afines al gobierno en el congreso y con ello se ha demostrado que poca cosa se puede confiar en lo ganado (al menos frente a lo que ha "" cedido"" el gobierno central)."
3256,"Gracias en por tus palabras.

En mis 3 décadas de existencia realmente no me habían sentido tan lleno de desesperanza, frustración y decepción. No veo un futuro en este pais. He sido privilegiado, soy profesional de una de las universidades de mayor prestigio del país y desde que me gradué hace 10 años he tenido trabajo. Si yo me siento así, no me imagino el nivel de frustración y desesperanza de los jóvenes menos privilegiados.

Me quedo con lo que dices, nuestra situación es compleja y tomará tiempo mucho tiempo en llegar soluciones de fondo. Nuestra lucha consistirá entonces en asegurar que estemos en la senda correcta hacia el cambio"
3257,De acuerdo.
3258,Sobretodo le devolvieron la popularidad a Uribe jajajaja. Si algo le hizo el paro al CD y a Uribe es mostrar lo desconectados que están con el pueblo y con lo que quieren. No digo que fortaleció a la izquierda. Pero no crea que la reforma tributaria que el CD casi le mete al país le encantó a todo el mundo.

3260,"No estoy de acuerdo contigo. El pobre no es pobre porque quiere. Mucha gente se esfuerza, estudia y trabaja de forma honrada. Pero a pesar de su esfuerzo nunca sale de pobre. La movilidad social del país es inexistente, se requieren 11 generaciones para salir de pobre.

Hay frustración porque a pesar del esfuerzo no hay avances y la clase política y la élite que ha gobernado el país no hace nada."
3261,"Imagínate la gente como yo... que a pesar de ser profesional graduada hace 10 años de Univalle no pude tener un empleo estable porque en mi profesión todo depende de la rosca. Como decidí que no iba a sembrar corrupción, he tenido que trabajar en lo que me saliera; desde logística en una pista de patinaje en un centro comercial hasta empleada doméstica de un extranjero (que es mi trabajo actual). Mi tiempo libre lo invierto en fortalecer mi emprendimiento y hago lo posible por hacerlo crecer. Aún así no voy a huir de mi país. Voy a seguir luchando para aportarle al cambio. Para que las generaciones venideras de científicos puedan tener empleos y verdaderas oportunidades laborales.  Voy a apostarle a sembrar un mejor país. No importa que no lo vea manifestado en lo que me queda de vida, vivo con la certeza de que nada es permanente."
3262,"A nadie le gustó, ese es mi punto.
Si hubiesen dejado de joder Justo después de que presidencia desistiera con la reforma ya nadie lo querría."
3263,"Una persona pobre,no estudia ya que el salirio de su familia es bajo y no alcanzaría a costearse los estudios universitarios,creo que a lo que te refieres de movilidad es a la clase media baja,la cual si estudia sea a base de préstamo, y sigue siendo clase baja, pero el mundo cambio y ahora no es necesario ir a la universidad para progresar puedes aprender a programar y certificarte gratis y trabajar muy bien,lo digo por experiencia,pero para eso hay que cambiar el paradigma mental,revelarse contra ese pensamiento de víctima,y tener fortaleza cognitiva,ahora más que nunca se necesitan personas que sepan de tecnología,éxitos y ojalá sepas que se puede todo es cuestión de misent y ahora con todo esto de la pandemia,cambiar de rubro."
3264,"Si parce, pero que a mucha gente no le haya parecido las formas del paro no significa que eso le dio popularidad a Uribe. Los que veo que se pueden beneficiar bastante si son Enrique Peñalosa, Fico y Char. No apoyaron el paro nunca pero tampoco apoyaron la reforma. Una gran sección de la población se va a sentir identificada con eso."
3265,"Te recomiendo este libro:

[https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Michael-J-Sandel-ebook/dp/B08BX9QJFX/ref=sr\_1\_3?\_\_mk\_es\_US=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=1YE800697NW8G&dchild=1&keywords=la+tirania+de+la+meritocracia&qid=1623804894&sprefix=la+tirania+de+la+meri%2Caps%2C224&sr=8-3](https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Michael-J-Sandel-ebook/dp/B08BX9QJFX/ref=sr_1_3?__mk_es_US=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=1YE800697NW8G&dchild=1&keywords=la+tirania+de+la+meritocracia&qid=1623804894&sprefix=la+tirania+de+la+meri%2Caps%2C224&sr=8-3)

Me parece super interesante porque critica el modelo de universidades y el credidencialismo que se ha creado alrededor del tema. Te aportaria perspectivas interesantes. La idea central del libro es que la meritocracia moderna crea ganadores arrogantes que creen que su posicion privilegiada es producto de su esfuerzo y perdedores humillados que creen que no sea han esforzado lo suficiente. Esta forma de pensar crea muchos problemas que son explicados en el libro. Por ejemplo hace que los ganadores sean menos solidarios o que el estado se meta en la vida de los perdedores para ver si se han esforzado lo suficiente y por lo tanto merecen un subsidio. En verdad es un muy buen libro. Te lo recomiendo, te dará nuevas perspectivas en que pensar.

Creo que estas juzgando las cosas mucho desde tu posicion y experiencia. Que bueno que hayas conseguido trabajo como programador. Efectivamente es una area que no requiere titulos, unicamente habilidades practicas. Pero no todos pueden ser programadores. Para ser programadores se requieren ciertas habilidades que no todo el mundo tiene por mas que estudien. Ademas, tampoco a todo el mundo le gusta. Que tu disfrutes pasar 6, 8 u 12 horas diarias frente a un PC no quiere decir que todo el mundo lo disfrute. Que pasará con las personas que no les gusta? Basado en tu experiencia, no puedes concluir simplemente que  solo es cuestion de esforzarse o cambiar el mindset. Es problema es mas complejo todavia, no lo simplifiques tanto!

Aqui un video que tambien podria aportarte otros puntos de vista

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ML6ABJqBU\_g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ML6ABJqBU_g)

El estudio que te envie sobre movilidad social en el pais con parametros objetivos de la economia nos permite concluir que realmente no existen las condiciones para que la gente salga de pobre o no retrocedan si lo llegan a hacer. Fijate que la conclusion de estos economistas no es que la gente no quiere salir de la pobreza."
3266,"Agree... aunque se me hace que despues de la tumbada de la reforma la de la salud habria sido mejor. Habrian quedado como *salvadores* y el pais se habria ido contra Duque por haber creado tal problema  lol. Esto al irse tan largo y tener tanta desorganizacion lo que ha hecho es que muchos colombianos se esten moviendo a la derecha o los grupos Paramilitares esten creciendo de nuevo. No controlar a muchos de los que hacen vandalismo le ha pasado su factura a los del paro tambien. Yo tengo un vecino que era full-petro  y apoyaba resto las marchas pero una vez vio que no le estaba llegando el surtido a su almacen ahora anda pensando en votar por otra opcion.   


Solo mi opinion.   


Yo solo espero que esto realmente sirva para llevar a Colombia a un mejor lugar. Todo pasa por una razon. Creo que estas marchas han permitido darse cuenta sobre muchas cosas en el pais."
3267,"Si el paro se hubiese desmovilizado en el momento en que se bajo la reforma, la reforma la volverian a subir meses despues, y ni el paro ni el cansancio sirvio de nada. Hay que ser un poco mas ambicioso."
3268,"Siempre me ha parecido que el pueblo colombiano no sabe de protesta, es más bien una sociedad acostumbrada a agachar la cabeza. A estas alturas ya no se va a conseguir nada, el gobierno no va a negociar, porque el paro y los bloqueos en si mismos le convienen, juega con el cansancio de la gente para sacar ventaja política, hace las veces de salvador de una situación que no le interesa arreglar. Las marchas y las protestas son un procedimiento que supone un costo y una inversión muy alta para lograr algo, no solo en Colombia, sino en cualquier parte del mundo, en cualquier lugar del mundo se presentan desmanes y se salen de curso ( estoy seguro que a ninguno nos gustan esas cosas) pero en algunas ocasiones sin algo de eso la sociedad no logra moverse, no pretendo hacer una justificación del vandalismo, pero aquí, antes de conseguir algo la sociedad ya quiere volver a normalidad porque se canso, por eso es una sociedad acostumbrada a agachar la cabeza.

En cuanto a los infiltrados en las protestas, ni  siquiera se puede descartar que que exista de los dos bandos, desde los extremistas que dañar y destrozar es el único camino para reclamar, hasta los que usan los mismos destrozos  para desacreditar la protesta social misma, pues en ese caso particular siempre es más fácil culpar al que sale a protestar.

En fin, no hará falta desde el que no quiera la protesta aunque tenga necesidades y motivos pero prefiero callarse y aguantarse, hasta el que no la quiere, simplemente porque ni leva ni le viene y como están las cosas le parece más conveniente para sus intereses, algo así como si no me afecta, no es mi problema."
3269,"Mi opinion: aunque la reforma como tal fue el detonante del estallido social no se puede tomar en cuenta como la única causa, los sectores vulnerables que son casi un 50% del país (hogares donde los hijos no pueden estudiar y deben elegir entre salir a vender dulces para apoyar a su familia o morir de hambre) actualmente no tienen nada que perder, ni vivienda digna, ni educación, ni salud, ni alimento, por eso eso se llegó a un punto donde no les importa morir, al final, con el abandono que han sufrido, con tantas noches yéndose a dormir acostado a los hijos con hambre, pues la muerte es el único gesto lindo que la vida tendría con ellos, por eso, no estoy a favor de que se levante la movilización hasta que estos grupos lo decidan, porque la movilización es de ellos, los que comemos 3 veces al día no deberíamos ni siquiera discutirlo


Hay otro problema y es que el gobierno no está interesado en hablar con esta población, por ese mismo motivo no se llega a ningún acuerdo con el comité de paro aunque este haya sido prácticamente armado por el gobierno, porque no les interesa, quieren que los pobres sigan bloqueando porque solo van a afectar a otros pobres, y final, los pobres de derecha en su burbuja de privilegios que no son tan privilegios pensarán que el verdadero enemigo son los pobres anti derecha que actualmente se mueren de hambre

En resumen, estamos ante otro triste episodio de la historia colombiana"
3270,"Conozco a una persona relativamente cercana y que es algo conocedora del ambiente político en su interior, así como de los movimientos electorales, él expuso una teoría que se ajusta a lo que usted señala, dijo "" cuando la protesta se radicaliza, lo que ocurre es que la gente se derechiza"", creo que es a eso a lo que le apuesta el gobierno al no negociar, le apuesta a que la gente se canse, se agote de las protestas, al punto de que les afecte, para aparecer no como un gobierno injusto y retrógrado, sino como el salvador del caos y sobre todo del mal que deja la protesta.

Ojalá todo esto sirva sobre todo al momento de ir a las urnas para hacer una elección más madura y consciente, que le pase factura al sistema actual escogiendo mejores gobernantes, y no hablo ni siquiera de votar por Petro, sino de hacerlo de manera más coherente, independientemente de la opción que se escoja."
3271,"Si, pero lastimosamente y con riesgo a que me downvoteeen a lo loco....la reforma de una u otra manera es necesaria. La pandemia dejo un hueco fiscal muy grande y se necesita de alguna estrategia para recuperar la economia del pais. No digo con eso que antes de la pandemia las cosas estuviesen bien o que haya que gravar los alimentos de la canasta basica como lo intento hacer Duque...pero si toca de alguna manera hacer algo al respecto. Todas las grandes crisis no solo.en Colombia sino en la historia del mundo han usado planes similares ""Plan Marshall"" ""el New Deal"" y otros q seguro no recuerdo. En este caso tumbar la reforma tributaria no me parece q haya sido el gran logro del paro como muchos lo quieren poner, sino que lo que hizo fue retrasar algo q es inevitable, espero que alguna nueva estrategia surja de todo este lioy que asi todo lo q se ha sufrido estos ultimos meses haya valido verdaderamente la pena."
3272,Exacto bro. Eso es lo que el quiere. Ellos son maquiavelicos jajajajaa.  Sera esperar en que manos caemos. Yo votare por alguien que me parezca estable y no sea de los mismos. Sera esperar los candidatos que habran. Solo espero que Colombia esta decada vaya en mejor camino y tenga un tipo de renacimiento. Vale soñar.

Tal vez por eso el paro no está consiguiendo nada significativo."
3274,podrian comenzar por reformar la reforma del 2019...
3275,"La reforma habría funcionado, pero hay que recordar que vivimos en Colombia ¿Cuánta plata no se hubiesen robado? XD"
3276,"Yo concuerdo con que la reforma es inevitable. Sin embargo, la reforma se concentra en pedir impuesto a las personas con pocos recuerdos o recursos de estrato medio. Hay muchos mas lugares de donde obtener dinero."
3277,"Si es verdad, ciertamente la corrupcion empeora este escenario.....tal vez esta reforma con el gobierno de turno ya no fue."
3278,"Una opinión impopular pero muy buena parcero!! 

La gente tiene que empezar a cambiar desde el interior, todos esperan que alguien les regale sobretodo en latinoamerica. Mis primos desde Colombia se la pasan diciéndome que les ayude a salir del país y me piden y me piden plata pero nunca quieren dar algo a cambio. Una vez le ayudamos a uno a venir a estudiar (Le pagamos todo) y al final no le gusto por que era muy difícil y se devolvió a hacer nada. Estoy a favor de la protesta y sé que el gobierno tiene la culpa de muchas cosas pero sé que la mayoría de la gente que conozco en Colombia no se quieren esforzar lo suficiente y no quieren cambiar para bien. Ahorita mi primo esta protestando por supuesta falta de oportunidades. 

La izquierda y la derecha es pura manipulación. En mi familia si digo algo bueno de petro ya me tildan de guerrillero y de vago, pero si voy a mi grupo de amigos y digo algo bueno del gobierno de Uribe me tratan mal y me tratan de estupido o de asesino. Todos se la pasan mirando posts o noticias de un solo lado sin mirar el otro y comparar y no aceptan un pensamiento diferente. Los del centro somos más pero nos tratan de obligar a escoger. Si matan a un manifestante, que mataron al vago. Si matan a un policía, que es que se lo merece. La polarización es lo que tiene al país jodido, la gente no se dan cuenta que somos de lo mismo, el gobierno lo sabe entonces usa la estrategia de separar al rival y manipular ambos bandos para que peleen. Por eso llevamos en lo mismo desde la independencia. Mi abuelita me decía que en la época de la violencia la gente no votaba por la persona que era la mejor para el cargo sino por la persona que dijera el partido liberal o conservados. El gobierno nos quiere separados y la gente no se quiere unir. Por eso yo también pienso que Colombia es un pueblo mediocre. El país va a seguir así hasta que se vuelva todo una guerra civil que puede durar otros 100 años y probablemente lo mejor divida el país entre izquierda y derecha. Lastimosamente como muchos me tuve que ir."
3279,"Comparto mucho tu opinión, algo que también quiero destacar es la buena variedad de opiniones en este subreddit, poniéndolo en contraste con otras redes sociales, acá no se es tan víctima de la burbuja  de opinión en la que te envuelven las demás, acá he leído todo tipo de opiniones que aunque no las comparto todas, permiten forjar un pensamiento más sólido y dejar de lado la polarización"

3282,"parce si! estoy 100% de acuerdo. eso se lo debemos a la mala educación del país. la gran mayoría jamas pasa de bachillerato, y por lo que he visto, muchos de ellos no tiene siquiera buen nivel de compression de lectura. Con tan bajo nivel, la mayoría solo cree lo que escucha y simplemente se deja llevar. Para los que quieren educación superior, tienen dos opciones: O son medianamente tesos, o tienen plata. yo trabaje en Admisiones de la UDEA, y cada carrera abre unos 100 a 200 cupos por semestre. Solo pasa como el 5% de los que se presentan. y de ese 5% mas del 30% no llegan a segundo semestre. En resumen: La falta de oportunidades, bajo nivel de educación, y una obsesión de obtener todo de forma fácil heredada de la era del narcotrafico. nos ha convertido en un país de importaculistas que solo se interesan por saber que dicen los famosos y ricos porque ellos quieren llegar a ser famosos y ricos pero sin esfuerzo, y como no tienen educación, no se identifican con los académicos y lo que dicen ellos son bobadas, así que mas fácil le creen a una cadena de Whatsapp con palabras como HUBIERON, HAIGAN y demás horrores ortográficos, porque es mas fácil creer en conspiraciones que en hechos. y es mas fácil echarle la culpa a la guerrilla que a los verdaderos culpables. NOSOTROS!"
3283,"Hmm te daria un premio si tuviera. Yo la verdad estoy cansado con el odio que destilan ambos bandos. Todas las muertes son terribles y no es para alegrarse. Ademas como lo mencionabas Muchos de los Actores-Musicos y deportistas saben solo de su campo. No todos son expertos en Politica para decir las cosas adecuadas en especial con lo confusa que esta la situacion. Ademas poner algo politico los pondria en riesgo al ser figuras publicas facilmente reconocibles.

Shakira recientemente puso algo apoyando a los del paro y que pararan las matanzas. Como la recibieron en los comments???? Le dijeron que era muy tarde que ya no servia de nada su comment. Que mejor se callara y que ella no era Colombiana cuando lleva decadas apoyando al pais mas que muchos. Tambien los Uribistas la atacaron horrible. Si no hablan mal. Si hablan mal. Que pereza. Recientemente atacaron a Juanes cuando el tampoco estaba de acuerdo con las matanzas.

Cuidado te tachan de ""gente de bien"" o ""tibio"" solo por tener algo de objetividad y cordura."

3286,primera vez que veo alguien diciendo la verdad...
3287,"Personalmente detesto hablar de política con amigos y familiares, ni yo se que tengo definido como bueno o malo pero si algo tengo que decir es que si en internet las cámaras de eco ya son un problema bastante fuerte en los medios tradicionales es aun peor, uno que ya tiene un caminado acá maso menos tiene una idea general de como no caer en estas o al menos no ser tan pendejo manteniéndose a raya frente a estas. Aunque sinceramente celebrar la muerte de cualquiera es un estupidez tremenda, siento que una parte bastante grande del país aun tiene como única fuente de información los medios tradicionales que tristemente desde que empezó todo esto han ninguneado de una forma bastante fea las muertes de civiles que ni uno ni ellos saben con certeza que mierda paso y han glorificado a los heridos de la policía que dicho sea de paso son solo minions que andan comiéndose la mierda de las cagadas que hacen sus superiores por que si de internet aprendí algo es que por unos pocos pagan todos sin importar el bando en el que estés, siempre hacen mas ruido y se le pone mas atención a los que tienen malas intenciones.

Me parece que esta frase es lo único que se necesita para representar la idiosincrasia del país."
3289,"Parcero, de acuerdo con usted en casi todo

Solo un pequeño punto en el que no estoy de acuerdo, y expongo mi argumento:

Colombia dejará de ser un pueblo mediocre cuándo reciba una mejor formación en la casa que haga que la gente se pueda valer por si misma y no depender de papá Estado, una dónde se prime el trabajo honesto y no la rosca o el fraude para enriquecerse o donde se elimine de la educación en casa la famosa (por desgracia) ""malicia indígena"". Ese es el fin de mi argumento con respecto a ese pequeño punto 

Para los que critican al fútbol, Yo las he pasado verdes cuando niño, y mi mamá sin apoyo del Estado me sacó adelante, aprendí el valor del trabajo y de valerme por mí mismo sin robarle a nadie lo que bien se ha ganado. El fútbol nos distraía de los problemas por 90 minutos cada día cuándo Colombia jugó el mundial del 98, es algo terapéutico  y que ayuda a despejar la mente y disfrutar unos momentos de distracción. El fútbol no es la causa de los males, es mucho más personal, de la casa"
3290,Lo mas sensato que he visto en este subreddit
3291,"Lo único raro de ayer es que entro publico después de que el gobierno perdiera aplazar la copa por culpa del covid y así pudiera asistir el público.

Ahora eso de pedirle a los famosos su opiniones en política est mandado a recoger, ellos nunca ganan al decir de que lado están y nuncan son la clave de solucionar el problema. 

Solo mira lo que le pasó a Falcao por algo que puso hace rato en su Twitter o con el caso de Amparo con Margarita."
3292,"Mira que llego a estar de acuerdo con muchas de las cosas que dices, especialmente con lo de no alegrarse por la muerte de policías (o más bien de seres humanos), pero me parece que estás hablando de una forma como si tú no estuvieras criticándolos a ellos de la misma forma que asumes que te criticarían, te dicen tibio y tú a ellos extremistas. El centrismo también es una posición política que puede llevarse al extremo, y lamentablemente si una cosa es cierta es que el país necesita algún cambio grande, lo complicado es saber desde dónde. Nos guste o no, la farándula moviliza a las personas, y eso es algo que también ocurre en otros países más ""avanzados"". Muchos aquí a duras penas alcanzan a subsistir y menos tiempo tienen para detenerse a estudiar el país a fondo. Puede que eso sí les haga ""mediocres"" pero ése no me parece que sea un comentario que ayude a solucionar los problemas de fondo que llevan a eso, sólo polariza de la misma forma que tú estás criticando, es como decir que este país está lleno de mamertos que no quieren trabajar o de paracos. Lo que sí queda claro es que estamos en un momento en el que la gente está desesperada y no sabe que más hacer. Es necesario tomar acción, pero eso lleva al riesgo del extremismo; sin embargo, no tomarla lleva al riesgo de que no se resuelva nada y el paro al final sólo deje al país más desgastado."

Eso es lo que molesta, todo estos futbolista millonarios que prefieren comprarse un Lamborghini envés de darle un techo a los más pobres. Creo que tú opinion es válida hasta cierto punto, pero no es cierto que el fútbol no sea una cortina de humo porque si lo es y además lo han usado para lavar dinero, entonces como qué es momento de reevaluar si necesitamos fútbol en este momento.

Tienes totalmente la razón. Mira el caso de Amparo Grisales: en Twitter hacían puras bromas de ''¿Qué país le vamos a dejar a nuestros hijos y a Amparo Grisales?'' hasta que ella misma salió a criticar Margarita Rosa de Francisco y al Paro en general. 

Queremos las opiniones de los demás pero nos indignamos cuando no son las nuestras."
3313,"u/kubick123 No quiero generalizar y solo estoy hablando desde mi experiencia. De las 150 personas que conozco bien en Colombia, 100 son jóvenes. Me crie en estrato 2 pero gracias al trabajo de mis papas pasamos a 3, así que la mayoría de la gente que conozco es estrato 3 pero conozco de estrato 2 y de 5. De esos jóvenes el 40% fue o esta en la universidad. Como un 60% de los que están en la universidad solo quieren salir rápido para parchar con los amigos. Muchos de los que estudian IT me dicen que les haga la tarea y no es por que sea difícil si no por que quieren hacer otras cosas o no entendieron el tema(y no se animan a preguntar o a buscar) y después o se echan la materia o al final del semestre le ruegan al profesor que les deje un trabajo para pasar raspando. 

El otro 40% es gente seria que estudia y trabaja. De los serios hay un 60% de probabilidad que encuentre trabajo depende de el esfuerzo que hizo. 

Los que no fueron a estudiar la gran mayoría se fue a buscar trabajo de albañil y a vivir del día a día, los otros viven con los papas sin hacer nada diciendo que no se mueven por falta de oportunidades.

Hay muchas oportunidades que no son fáciles de conocer por ejemplo en mi campo de IT muchas empresas de USA o aquí en Japón donde buscan gente de Latinoamérica o India(demasiada gente es contratada así) para que trabajen remotamente. Hay competencias de programación donde no es necesario ganar, pero con demostrar buena habilidad las grandes compañías de tech lo buscan para qué les trabaje. Saber ingles da mucha ventaja y es lo que más le recomiendo a la gente, por qué no saben la información que se pierden. Conozco una muchacha que se graduó de música pero sabiendo ingles le dieron trabajo en un call center en ingles y le pagan mucho más del mínimo. En mi caso me metí a un culto en donde ellos me pagaron la educación en Estados Unidos y nunca en mi vida pensé que eso era posible.

Es cierto que Colombia esta muy mal y la desigualdad es terrible pero el que sabe lo que quiere puede conseguirse una buena oportunidad que le cambie la vida."

JAMAS los dos lados seran iguales, debido a la moral, valores y el monton de corrientes que existen dentro de estas mismas difiriendo en temas politicos, economicos y sociales, y es importante saber esto para ser mas objetivo a la hora de criticar

Ah, y no, tampoco es que yo quiera que todos se hagan matar por su partido y que anden siempre peleandose, obviamente seria mejor si la cultura colombiana, e incluso en otros paises, fuese menos violenta y conflictiva en estos temas y en otros miles mas"
3316,"No sabía que ser sensato era reducir una historia de conflicto ideológicos y políticos a un discurso como ""ambos lados son malos"". Eso no ayuda en nada. Ambos lados NO son iguales y nunca lo serán, sin importar que usted pueda hacer una crítica de los dos y trate de equipararlos y esto se hace mucho más evidente en Colombia gracias al conflicto."
3317,"Pero es que decir, que el pueblo colombiano es mediocre, es una generalización estupida, hay gente que nació en una extrema pobreza, trabajan todo el dia y por mantener a su familia y demás, no tuvieron tiempo de estudiar nunca.
Por que cada situación de cada colombiano es diferente por ejemplo.

El pueblo colombiano para mi, es analfabeta o ignorante, pero no mediocre, yo crecí en un ambiente de gente campesina, que gente para trabajar y para hacer cosas increible, esa gente no solo que nunca ponen un pero para hacer las cosas, si no que las hacen, si esa gente no tuviesen la necesidad inmediata de trabajar para suplir sus necesidades y la de sus seres cercanos, creame que todos serian estudiosos.
Pero lastimosamente, cada colombiano es una historia unica.

La vida es dura, tanto, que por más que usted trabaje y se esfuerce, puede que nunca logre algo por las circunstancias mismas de la vida.

Con respecto al punto de la India, hay mucha gente de allá que logra, un buen empleo tanto por trabajo más las circunstancias del empleo, su vida en ese momento.
Como otros que los tienen literalmente amarrados en trabajos de mierda, por las H1B.

Fuera de eso he hecho cursos y certificaciones gratuitas. Opciones hay en educación."
3324,"Respecto a lo de elegir comer, el motivo por el que entré al SENA fue porque en mi familia ninguno tenía trabajo, así que las prácticas me venían de maravilla, eran 6 meses de trabajo asegurado y la posibilidad de que me contrataran después para algo, ya que sin experiencia en nada, no estaba obteniendo trabajo en nada.

Eso sí, no fue nada fácil, solía dormir solo 4 o 5 horas diarias para hacer los trabajos, y luego cuando estaba en prácticas hubo semanas en que llegaba a casa a las 2am para estar en el trabajo a las 8am. Pero ha valido la pena."

3330,"Pido disculpas por adelantado, texto largo a continuación.

**Problemática:**

Quiero iniciar con lo siguiente del lado de la educación: Si considero que en algunas instituciones lo que se aprende no es mucho, y hay temas que considero nos son faltantes, ya que muchas situaciones se podrían resolver de forma distinta si todos contásemos con ciertos conocimientos desde la adolescencia.

Aún así, la posición que hay respecto a que es la educación pública la que siempre enseña muy poco la veo errónea, la educación privada necesita ofrecer algo para que las personas estén dispuestas a pagarla, y tal vez que pongamos estos conocimientos como lo mínimo para un trabajo es lo que está mal. Hay algo que me enseñaron hace muchos años, ya no recuerdo exactamente quien y era lo siguiente:

Cada categoría de la educación tiene un propósito, las carreras técnicas están para enseñar lo necesario para la ejecución de una tarea o profesión, siendo más o menso un 80/20 entre conocimientos prácticos y conocimientos teóricos. Las carreras tecnológicas están para enseñarte en partes iguales teoría y practica, de forma que sabes como se ejecuta una tarea y tienes las bases para tomar las decisiones requeridas en el momento cuando se presentan situaciones no contemplables en la planeación. Las carreras profesionales buscan enseñar la mayor cantidad de conocimientos teóricos para realizar el análisis y planeación previos necesarios para la ejecución de un proyecto a mayor escala. En resumen era algo así:

|Tipo de carrera|Conocimientos prácticos (%)|Conocimientos teóricos (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Técnico|80|20|
|Tecnólogo|50|50|
|Profesional|20|80|

**Mi contexto personal:**

Ahora, para seguir mi propia propuesta, mi contexto.  
Mi educación inicial fue privada, y en un colegio que me permitió adquirir unos conocimientos de varias materias como política y economía, ya que eran una materia de 10mo y 11vo grado. Eso si, no era un colegio de elite o algo así, el costo de la mensualidad era de unos 150.000 pesos hace 7 años.

Luego de esto fue la educación pública en el SENA, mi carrera es programación de software (por si a alguien le interesa, espero que no). Para continuar hacia carrera profesional en universidad privada (esto como sugerencia de uno de mis jefes, un hombre que respeto mucho).

**Mi propuesta:**

Hay que hacer cambios en la educación, eso es cierto, pero también hay que pensar en qué conocimientos nos hacen falta, ya que a veces pedimos cosas que de mejor o peor manera ya existen en nuestro país, solo que a veces las ignoramos. 

Pero también hay que reevaluar nuestro concepto del mínimo requerido, ya que si solicitamos conocimientos avanzados para tareas de ejecución, o para cargos que no requieren dichos conocimientos, estamos propiciando un circulo vicioso en el cual cada vez es más un despropósito el tener un sistema educativo escalonado (en teoría primero se es técnico, luego tecnólogo y por último profesional según como se de la vida profesional).

En conclusión, la educación si debe cambiar, pero también nuestra visual de que es lo necesario en la educación y para que tareas esto debería bastar, no tener los tipos de títulos como un adorno, cada uno tiene una implicación, respetémosla."
3331,"Bueno, antes de hablar de revoluciones, habría que conocer todo el panorama, así como las herramientas que ya hayan para hacer cambios, o los cambios que solo necesitan ejecutarse y no implementarse.

Lo que usted comenta de los aviones, debo leerlo, ya que no conozco los detalles. Pero si usted tiene alguna idea de en qué sector habría hecho falta esa inversión, me gustaría leerla."
3332,"La verdad veo la opción de evaluar o cambiar educación como algo viable, también se necesita mayor cobertura, todavía hay un 20% que no tiene acceso.

Lo que tú dices de conocimientos avanzados simplemente no es viable en un mundo globalizado, si hay mano de obra mas barata e igual o me costosa los industriales simplemente no van a venir, hay que ser competitivo. 

Lo que se puede es hacer un sistema por escalafones, muy estandarizado, algo similar a nuestro sistema de colegio, pero reduciría la calidad general de la educación al limitar mucho los temas que se pueder tocar y como se pode hacer. Y tendría otra ventaja, no más eternos en la u."
3333,"Socio, usted la tiene clara no ha pensado en compartir este pensamiento o propuesta en algun otro lugar Aparte de Reddit? Colombianos en Reddit somos pocos, un grupo en algun otro lugar puede ayudar"
3334,"Perdón nuevamente, texto largo a continuación.

Disculpa u/sapajul, no se si entiendo correctamente tu idea, lo que entiendo es esto:

**Sobre el sistema de educación:**

Entiendo que se buscaría hacer obligatoria esta escalada entre los títulos profesionales, de alguna manera, como podría ser por normativa, aunque creo que en este sentido es mejor no involucrar a las leyes, sino que sea algo más de nosotros como comunidad. (Si me disculpas, tengo muchos inconvenientes personales con la idea de que todo sea manejado por leyes o autoridades, siento que quita la capacidad de auto-control a la larga)

Respecto a lo de hacer un sistema de escalones, sobre el papel, esto es lo que son los títulos de técnico, tecnólogo y profesional, en teoría uno debería iniciar preferiblemente como técnico para obtener empleo con mayor facilidad. Luego, con tiempo y experiencia, buscar pasar al grado de tecnólogo, adquiriendo los conocimientos más teóricos. Así finalmente está el grado de profesional, el cual se buscaría cuando la persona desee aspirar a las posiciones más altas y de responsabilidad y planeación.

Con esto los cargos deberían tener una correspondencia más o menos así:

&#x200B;

|Título|Tipo de cargos que lo requieren|

|Técnico|Cargos de baja responsabilidad, basados en la ejecución de una tarea ya planificada. (Operarios, técnicos, asesoría, atención inicial al cliente, primera línea)|
|Tecnólogo|Cargos de baja o media responsabilidad que requieran el análisis de la situación para la toma de decisiones inmediatas en sitio. En mi opinión aquí podrían estar: Los primeros lideres de equipos, para equipos pequeños, aquellos encargados de problemas más complejos que un primera línea n pueda solucionar, tal vez todas las versiones ""senior"" de los cargos del nivel anterior.|
|Profesional|Cargos de responsabilidad, encargados de la planeación, administración y gestión de alto nivel. (Gerentes, administradores, lideres de área)|
|Especialización|Cargos de alta responsabilidad pero que a su vez requieran grandes conocimientos de un área específica|

**Acerca de requerimientos de contratación:**

En el caso de lo que expuse, lo de reevaluar que consideramos como requerimiento para un trabajo, lo dije por la siguiente situación:

Algunas ofertas laborales aquí en Colombia solicitan conocimientos o títulos de mucho mayor nivel de lo que la tarea a realizar requiere, y por lo tanto hacen que titulaciones que deberían corresponder a este nivel sean descartadas como no aptas EJ: Solicitar personas con título profesional para labores que se podrían hacer con conocimientos técnicos o tecnológicos.

Esto a su vez hace que todos busquemos dichas titulaciones desde el inicio de la vida laboral, y estas titulaciones obviamente son más costosas tanto en tiempo como en dinero. Así es como tenemos ofertas que buscan profesionales para ser operarios, o atención al cliente o realizar tareas que no requieren de los conocimientos que dicha titulación acarrea.

Esta situación la he visto mucho aquí, hablaré desde mi experiencia. En ocasiones me han llegado ofertas laborales de empresas nacionales, las cuales solicitan conocimientos muy avanzados (conocimientos que tiene uno de mis amigos y primer ""maestro"", el cual tiene más de 8 años de experiencia) para cargos de ""2 años de experiencia"" y con nombres tipo ""junior"" o simple ""programador"" (y el salario que esto implica). 

Por otra lado, he visto ofertas de empresas extranjeras o multinacionales, las cuales por estos mismos conocimientos buscan lideres de equipo o ""programadores senior"" de más de 5 años de experiencia, y por lo tanto el salario es el doble que el que ofrecemos aquí.

Entonces, ¿por qué aquí pedimos tantos conocimientos para un cargo básico y lo pagamos peor que en el extranjero?"
3335,"La verdad, esta es de las primeras veces en mi vida que he decidido compartir mi pensar públicamente.

¿Ustedes tienen alguna sugerencia de formas de tal vez hacer esto?"
3336,"Añado otra historia personal:

En mi primer trabajo, hace cerca de 4 años o así, el equipo de calidad éramos 4 personas, 3 ""tester"" (los que hacíamos como tal las pruebas de calidad) y nuestro líder de equipo. Los tester éramos todos graduados del SENA, e incluso yo era el mayor con 19, con el tiempo un compañero y yo empezamos a desear algo mejor laboralmente, yo quería pasar de calidad de software a desarrollo y este compañero un mejor salario.

Pasado un corto tiempo yo renuncié a la empresa para aceptar una oferta como desarrollador, una experiencia... digna de otro post tal vez. 

Por otro lado este compañero se cambio a una empresa extranjera, y le duplicaron el salario para realizar incluso menos trabajo, ya que en nuestro anterior cargo nosotros debíamos atender múltiples proyectos y trasnochar hasta por semanas seguidas, en su nuevo cargo solo debía ejecutar pruebas ya planificadas e incluso automatizadas (en otras palabras, solo revisar los resultados de una simulación).

Aquí pude terminar de confirmar algo que ya había visto antes, aquí buscamos personal con capacidad en teoría, muy superior a lo requerido y por el mismo salario. No apreciamos ni nuestras profesiones ni nuestros profesionales.

Y nos ha ido llevando poco a poco a tener profesionales mediocres, ya que adaptamos toda nuestra educación y aspiraciones como personas a este ambiente laboral donde el nombre del título ya no representa lo que debería."
3337,"Hay 3 situaciones aquí

En primer lugar tu tienes acceso a una visión limitada de la oferta laboral de cualquier lugar, acá en Colombia he visto los dos casos, ofertas laborales con títulos como director de procurement pidiendo elementos acordes a la oferta como MBA 10 años de experiencia y 15'000,000 y lo opuesto, con nombre propio, PQP pidiendo un Senior Cost Management, con 2 años de experiencia y por 2,000,000 COP. Pero esto es un simple juego de nombres y título, para jugar con la oferta de personal. 

El segundo punto es que el costo de una persona no se limita a cuánto pagas. Por ejemplo si comparas con un salario en USA sin beneficios, tienes que multiplicar el salario Colombiano por 1.57, porque acá hay unos beneficios de ley que son una carga conciderable para el empleador.

Por último es el tema de competitividad nacional, miremos una bolso, tipo Totto, puede hacerse en Colombia, China y hagamos un hipotético USA. Se vende en centro y suramérica, A un precio medio de 40 USD, de esos $40 tiene que salir todos los costos, entonces, china, la mano de obra es barata, el transporte a puerto es casi que grátis, la materia prima es aceptable en precio, en Colombia la mano de obra es muy barata, pero el transporte a puerto es mortal, y los costos de materiales también son altos. En el hipotético USA el transporte y la materia prima son expectaculares, la mano de obra es terrible. Este balance es complejo y varía con cada producto, pero como es un mundo globalizado, hay muchos factores que hacen que la cosa sea mucho más que simplemente decir paguemos más."
3338,"Bueno, respecto a salarios, no considero que una solución sea incrementar su valor, más bien lo considero una problemática tal y como tu la expones, ya que el alto costo de cada empleado para una empresa que causan parafiscales y otros beneficios que aquí poseemos hace casi imposible para una gran empresa la idea de ofrecer sueldos altos, o para pequeñas empresas la idea de crecer hasta ser medianas o grandes.

En mi anterior respuesta no trataba de indicar que el salario sea lo que está mal, sino el perfil profesional buscado, de momento no me involucro con salarios ya que es un tema muy complejo y extenso que depende de muchos factores relativos.

Es verdad lo que comentas de esta tendencia a adquirir únicamente el producto de menor valor, pero no es una regla siempre válida, eso también depende del mercado objetivo, ya que otros factores como calidad, ser producto ""artesanal"", producto ""de lujo"", afectan la demanda. Ahora, si tratamos de competir únicamente con estrategia de dar el menor precio, siempre estaremos en desventaja si queremos a la vez ofrecer beneficios a nuestros trabajadores. Es por esto que en mi opinión, desde el inicio esta descartado el competir en este aspecto, así que es necesario dar un valor agregado a aquello que ofrecemos al mundo."
3339,"Creo que fue Porter el que dijo que las estrategias por precio no son sostenibles, pero el precio siempre debe ser parte de la estrategia. Colombia ha logrado lo que tú mencionas con el café, pero eso requiere siglos de trabajo y un elemento diferenciadores, en la época moderna es difícil y depende de los gremios y empresas para generar la diferencia.

Otros ejemplos en Colombia son el pescado, flores y cacao. Me atrevería a decir que azul ultra mar también.

El problema con esta idea es que como puedes ver es limitada. Y genera competencia interna, y vuelve nuevamente al precio. 

Necesitamos mejorar la competitividad y reducir los costos de flete, la situación es que ésto no se logra con protestas, quejas o violencia. Históricamente solo lo han logrado países con una política estable que favorece la inversión extragera, un ejemplo en Latinoamérica es Chile, aunque ellos lo lograron de forma cuestionable."
3340,"Yo voy primero,

Un pirobo que yo ni conocía y su parche llegaron a mi casa porque un ricachón que me cae como el orto y es el que pone el chorro. Este pirobo era un completo pelmaso, se la pasaba pendiente de facebook, acaparaba la comida y la escondía para dársela a su combo y hasta rompió un pocillo y no avisó que la había cagado.

En fin, este cabrón, incluso después de que sus parceros más cercanos se fueran por las vergüenzas y el ridículo que hacían, nada que se iba. Ahí estaba, haciendo las mismas maricadas pero con gente que llamaba e invitaba a mi casa sin preguntarme.

A lo bien que mierda ese man, no sean como Duque. Si ven que ya la cagaron mucho, renuncien."

Es así también con lo que mencionas, alguien dijo que se deberían suspender todos los partidos y que no deberían jugar porque el país está en protesta, pero ni siquiera cuestionan que ese argumento era probablemente aceptable para no celebrar una Copa América en un país herido, pero que nada aplica para un partido de un torneo diferente que así como mencionas ya venía planificado con anterioridad y que no se celebra en el país.

El hecho de que estemos furiosos con nuestro gobierno no debe ser excusa para querer parar al mundo entero, para que nos vean y se pronuncien, como un niño cuando busca atención.

A ver si descargan esa furia en las elecciones futuras."
3391,A esto me refiero y hay punto del paro qye estan bien pero otros que son ilogicos y los colomvianos del esterior haciendo protesta en un pais ageno donde no pueden hacer nada pir que no hya juridiccion y donde estan es interesados en mejorar es ese pais en cuastio piensan que los otros paises haran algo al respecto cuando es la onu como tal solo por las muertes en manifestaciones las cuales rechazo obviamente por que nunca hay que matar a alguien por que oiense diferente pero creen que haran algo llenando time square las protestas se hacen en el pais no en paises ajenos donde no hay juridiccion y ademas que no hacen nada tan orgullosos que la protesta es en un sitio que nada que ver y los ven es como inmigrantes nada mas es algo ilogico para mi no se que diras vos.

3399,"> el comité del paro hace mucho que no representa a nadie realmente y no es más que una partida de viejos sindicalistas que están igual de desconectados del país que este remedo de gobierno

Solamente están para hacer proselitismo para la izquierda."
3400,">el sindicato de taxis y su negativa a la reglamentación de las apps

Para eso hay muy buenas razones. Las apps no resuelven ningún problema, y sí aumentan la precariedad de los dueños y conductores de taxi. Además, las apps no quiere reglamentar el sector; quieren desreglamentarlo para poder hacer lo que quieran.

&#x200B;

>Lo que publico Mario Hernández aunque no sea cierto, no es alejado de la realidad

Que una mentira concuerde con nuestra opinión no la acerca a la realidad... No está ni cerca de ser cierto. Además, si así lo fuera, lo único que muestra es el dolor que le da ver a alguien distinto a él y a los suyos ganando plata.

Eso no quiere decir que fecode no sea la cagada. Salir a marchar y a hacer conciertos, pero negarse a retomar funciones es un sinsentido total.

&#x200B;

>el sindicato camionero y si oposición al tren

Esos sí son la cagada. Pero no son sólo los camioneros, son los dueños de los camiones. Esos dos grupos no son lo mismo."

A ellos no les importa el país. Solo les importa ellos mismos."
3402,There's only one thing that they are good for
3403,">Las apps no resuelven ningún problema

""La rueda no resuelve ningún problema"".

""La electricidad no resuelve ningún problema"".

""La física cuántica no resuelve ningún problema"".

Así de ridículo suena eso.

En cuanto a que las aplicaciones no quieran reglamentar, pues habrá algunas que sí, otras que no; a medida que pase el tiempo tendrán que ajustarse a las regulaciones laborales de todo el mundo."
3404,"Es claro que las apps no resuelven el problema de transporte, pero si que se necesita una regularización como cualquier otro sector. Justo ahora las apps están haciendo lo que quieran porque no hay regularización, no entiendo como una regularización desreglamentaria el sector de transporte. 

Quieres un ejemplo de como ganan los sindicalista te muestro EMCALI, la mafia sindical que existe es tan grande, que ningún alcalde ha podido con ella, Mauricio Armitage fue uno de los que más batalló y fue el que publicó las cifras y la cantidad de beneficios de un trabajador sindicalizado, llegando a que un aseador este ganando hasta 4 millones y empleados administrativos de nivel 1 lleguen a ganar hasta 15 millones

Si quieres leer el articulo completo de los beneficios ridiculos de los sindicalizados en EMCALI te dejo el link.

[https://incp.org.co/los-insostenibles-salarios-de-emcali/](https://incp.org.co/los-insostenibles-salarios-de-emcali/)

Sindicatos como los de EMCALI hay muchos, y el problema no es que ganen toda esa plata, el problema es que no les importa si la empresa esta en crisis y pierda competitividad como es el caso de EMCALI, solo les importa recibir sus beneficios y listo.

>Esos sí son la cagada. Pero no son sólo los camioneros, son los dueños de los camiones. Esos dos grupos no son lo mismo.

Los dueños de los camiones por lo general son los lideres sindicales de los camioneros, es como en los taxis, son los dueños de los taxis los lideres sindicales."
3405,">no entiendo como una regularización desreglamentaria el sector de transporte.

Por la regulación actual prohíbe explícitamente la modalidad de trasporte propuesta por las apps. Lo que quieren es que se eliminen esas reglas de funcionamiento (tarifa regulada, carros con placa especial, aportes a seguridad social, limites regionales para operación, etc) que no los deja funcionar como ellos quieren"
3406,"No entiendo como eso es malo, al contrario, hasta beneficia a los taxistas quitar tanta regularizaciones y costos absurdos como lo es el ""cupo"""
3407,"El problema es que ellos ya pagaron ese cupo por esa regulación... Haga la cuenta y verá el tamaño del problema. Hoy en día un cupo de taxi en Bogotá puede costar 80 millones. Eso no es un impuesto; es un precio de mercado resultado de las reglas de juego que dice (incomprensiblemente) que en Bogotá no puede haber más de 50k taxis. Ya hay gente que pagó eso por el derecho de tener un taxi legal en Bogotá. Cuando se permita operar sin ese requisito, ese cupo pasa a costar 0; el que ya pagó eso, perdió.

Hay 50k taxis en Bogotá. 50k\*80'000.000 = 4 BILLONES de pesos. 4 billones de pesos que simplemente se DESAPARECEN de un día para otro por quitar esa regulación para que Uber et. al. puedan seguir sacando plata de Colombia. Es un buen ejemplo de la importancia de la estabilidad jurídica."
3408,"El cupo no se paga anual, así que los 4 billones no desaparece de un día para otro, ahora habrá que ver cuales son las cifras de taxis nuevos que entran a circular pero no creo que cada año entren 50k taxis, y con la presentación de algunos taxis, se nota que hay muchos taxis más viejos que matusalen

Otra cosa, el sistema de cupo, ni siquiera es regulado por el estado, ese sistema solo lo usaron los grandes dueños de taxis que son los que venden los ""cupos"" para aprovecharse de una ley absurda y hacer negocio. Que se quite el cupo, solo le quita ese negocio, por eso no les conviene que lo hagan.

Lastima por los que ya lo pagaron, pero el ""cupo"" se debe de quitar junto con muchas otras regulaciones, esto para hacer el sector competitivo."
3409,"Claro, no es algo que se paga anual porque no es una tarifa, licencia, o impuesto del distrito o el estado. Y no se le paga al estado, es algo que ya pagaron todas las personas que tienen un taxi legal en Bogotá.

Pueden vender un carro vuelto mierda en 90 millones siempre y cuando tenga el cupo legal y luego ese cupo se puede pasar a un carro nuevo para seguir trabajando (el viejo se chatarriza o se vuelve carro particular con placa amarilla). Y esos 80 millones no los define el estado ni el distrito; es el precio normal de un taxi legal y la gente lo paga porque sabe que es una inversión rentable.

El día que quiten esa restricción esa gente pierde ese capital; el carro que antes costaba 90 millones ya no cuesta nada. Es capital colombiano, que está en manos de ciudadanos colombianos, se pierde de un día para otro porque ya nadie va a pagar esa plata pudiendo hacer lo mismo con un carro particular. Son 4 billones de pesos que se pierden de un plumazo...

Puede que la ley sea absurda, pero quitarla tiene consecuencias reales sobre personas reales que pierden su capital. No creo correcto que se haga tan abruptamente y menos para darle gusto a empresas con prácticas laborales y de impuestos muy cuestionables pa' que nos sigan ordeñando."
3410,"Una lastima, pero no es culpa de nadie, las inversiones son así, o puedes recuperar tu capital o puedes perderlo, las personas hacen negocio sabiendo eso, no tiene sentido que no se reforme un sector económico solo porque hay personas que perderán dinero. 

Además, estas viendo solo desde el punto de vista del que pierde, tienes que mirar también del que gana, el que iba a comprar un cupo de 80 millones, puede ahora comprarse dos carros y ponerlos a trabajar."
3411,"Según ellos  todos los demás son de Uribe, el único no corrupto es petro.  Petro es muy keynesiano, como es el gobierno actual. Creen que con petro Colombia cogerá el cielo con las manos."
3412,"Porque la polarización cegó a la gente. Para la gente de izquierda o de derecha todo es blanco o negro, no existe el gris. Si usted no es A entonces es B, cuando usted puede ser Q, 8 o #."
3413,La gente está loca y todos tienen el ego tan alto que creen que sus ideas serán as que salven el país.
3414,"Creo que es un fenomeno mental-psicologico del populismo asi como pasa con Trump/Bolsonaro/Chavez. Petro les ha vendido ideas-mentiras y ellos empiezen a sentir que el su amigo y salvador. Petro podria atacarles su propia familia y ellos aun estarian al lado de el dandole honra. Lo mismo le pasa a los Uribistas que tratan a Uribe como un Dios.   


A mi lo que mas me parece gracioso es que Petro es de los politicos que mas dinero tiene en este pais y muchos creen que es del pueblo lmfao. Ese señor vive desconectado de la realidad del Colombiano promedio.  Lo que ese tipo quiere es enriquecerse mas....como la mayoria.  


Yo soy de izquierda economicamente-ideologicamente y vote por petro en las elecciones pasadas pero una vez lo segui en twitter y vi sus entrevistas me di cuenta del riesgo tan enorme que es ese señor. Su lenguaje corporal denota odio y egocentrismo. Es tan malo como los politicos del ramo de Uribe. Tambien la manera en que glorifica a Venezuela-Cuba-Chavez es de miedo. Cuando el agua suena es porque piedras lleva.....  


Yo la verdad siento que hay un monton de personas en la izquierda que tienen la inabilidad de ver las cosas que estan mal en su partido y denunciarlas. Para ellos todo lo que hace la izquierda es bueno porque es la izquierda y si dices algo malo usan la violencia o te llaman ""tibio"" zzzzz. Este tipo de ""niebla mental"" termina convirtiendolos en algo tan malo como la Derecha.  Es como cuando las personas de la izquierda condenan las cosas horribles que hace Estados Unidos pero se niegan a ver las atrocidades que hace China como nacion. La objetividad se ha perdido en los partidos politicos y es lo que nos tiene tan mal.   


Podran atacarme pero yo lo reitero. El siguiente presidente de Colombia no debe ser alguien del centro democratico o petro. Debe ser alguien diferente."
3415,"Porque la gente sigue pensando que la solución está en el Estado o en un político profesional de turno. Por eso latinoamérica no prospera, literalmente siempre se busca un mesías y siempre sale estatista.

Debería darnos vergüenza seguir pensando así y creer que dándole poder al corrupto se acaba la corrupción y el malestar."

3417,"En el caso de los petristas, que son los que yo más he tratado, ellos no entienden que otras personas tienen otras visiones del mundo, que uno no comparte las premisas con las que ellos entienden la política o la sociedad. Por ejemplo ellos creen que supuestamente Duque se inventó los asesinatos de líderes, y que es Duque el que mata a los líderes, entonces creen muy ingenuamente que si Petro llega a ser presidente, esos asesinatos se van a acabar. Cuando la realidad muestra que los asesinos de los líderes son bandas criminales de diversas pelambres, entre ellas, las guerrillas, y que, en tanto esos grupos existan y operen, seguirán ocurriendo esos asesinatos. Es solo un ejemplo de muchos."

Pero viendo lo que ha sucedido en elecciones, encuestas y lo quemado que está Fajardo luego de sus guiños hacia el Uribismo, yo votaría por Petro una y mil veces, sencillamente porque el primer paso del largo cambio que se necesita es castigar en las urnas a las ratas de toda la vida, cosa que nunca ha sucedido lo que explica su descaro.

Un voto para un tibio que quiere tener a los Uribistas contentos no es un castigo, es un premio a su omnipotencia.

Y un voto en blanco o para alguien que nunca va a ganar las elecciones, es darle otro mandato para Uribe, sea cual sea la justificación. Esa es la realidad."
3421,"Porque no hay nueva sangre con posibilidades reales de llegar a un alto cargo, si no apoyas a Uribe entonces se piensa que deberías apoyar al segundo con más posibilidades de ganar, e igual si no apoyas a Petro.

Y lo de que si no estás con uno estás en su contra son cosa, lamentablemente, de los fanaticos que hay en los dos bandos no pueden sacar sus cabezas de sus culos y por eso piensan que Uribe o Petro son la única cosa que hay, lamentablemente son los únicos que que tienen una visibilidad alta."
3422,"Hay tanto fanatismo en la protesta que a veces creo que si se tuvieran que operar de urgencia, lo unico que les preocuparía es que el cirujano fuera de izquierda.

Yo estudié economía y por formación sé que la derecha funciona mejor, mientras la izquierda  vende mentiras, pero no soy fanático y si hay un buen líder de izquierda lo apoyo, como en las elecciones pasadas que le voté a Ospina en Cali (aunque este segundo periodo resultó decepcionante), para eso reviso datos y la percepción de la gente.

A Uribe lo acusan de infinidad de mentiras pero uno revisa su gestión como presidente y fue más que aceptable. Mientras otros como Petro solo sacan disculpas cuando fue alcalde."
3423,Estoy harto que me llamen paraco por dar mi opinión no petrista
3424,"Bueno yo creo que el tema tiene un poco más fondo y creo que es donde se aprovechan los dos lados, realmente es que siempre existe parte de las sociedades que quedan completamente desatendidas.

Si te fijas desde la constitución del 91 no se ha logrado avanzar en algún cambio sustancial en cómo funciona nuestro país... 

La función del órgano dedicado a legislar no genera nada que realmente requiera la sociedad y suba quien suba a la presidencia no va a cambiar eso.

Creo que es necesario pensar más en un modelo de democracias directas donde la sociedad periódicamente se le consulte cuál es el rumbo y las necesidades, creo que es es la clave para romper este ciclo de siempre pensar que un grupo es el que nos resolverá todo y que todos tomemos nuestras responsabilidades dentro de la sociedad.

Y desde que sigamos bajo este mismo modelo siempre de un lado van a atacar el otro, creo que el mayor triunfo para ellos es generar esa división.

En este video Everth Bustamante congrecista del partido CENTRO DEMOCRATICO y ex M-19 con honestidad reconoce que PEtro no participo en ninguna batalla, era un ideologo, que estaba alli por la ideologia revolucionaria, mas se abstuvo de cualquier hecho violento.  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2S\_RGRFGFU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2S_RGRFGFU)  


Entonces la gente lo llama, asesino, chavista, socialista y demas mentiras que dice la prensa, como no reaccionar mal cuando alguien que se come todas esas mentiras dice no gustarle Petro?  


A Petro le tienen miedo porque se comen la vil mentira del uribismo de que nos va a volver venezuela (que en un primer momento ya estabamos igual o peor y que el mismo uribismo con su titere con programa como el chavista alo presidente ya nos hiso dejar ver que ellos son los que no volvireron asi)

Entonces a Petro le tienen miedo por eso pero Petro sabe demasiado de economia, acaso el mismo Duque no hizo bombos y platillos de su programa de venta de Aguacates al exterior cuando el mismo Petro en su campaña presidencial del 2018 ya advertia del peligro de que Colombia siguiera dependiendo del Petroleo y no del agro? que paso luego? pasamos unos años donde el petroleo bajo a perdida, que tenerlo almacenado era perder plata y al contrario el aguacate se vende a mucho mas que el barril del petroleo hoy en dia.   


Que es lo malo de Petro? Curiosamente los que mas estan diciendo que los petristas no escuchamos y que no vemos como otros podrian tener ideas distintas son los que nunca han escuchado las propuestas de petro, abrir su mente y dicernir si lo que dice Petro tiene sentido o no, solo es puro prejuicio porque si Uribe es blanco entonces por lo tanto Petro es la otra esquina, Petro es Negro, ustedes los disque indecisos solo quieren olerse los peos y sentirse los moralmente correctos, pero no hacen una verga para dar una solucion al problema."
3432,"Pues al parecer, y espero me equivoque, es mas un asunto de ""tradición"" el decantarse por un partido político y por tanto el ver que alguien quiera algo diferente es romper esa ""tradición"" lo cual genera malestar a esas personas acostumbradas a seguir con un patron de pensamiento preestablecido. 

Afortunadamente se que no eres el único que desea algo totalmente diferente y no comulga con ninguno de los dos ""bandos políticos"" (yo incluida), asi que no te desanimes que este cambio de pensamiento tomará un tiempo, tal y como lo mencionaste el país lleva decadas polarizado por tanto llevará un tiempo el que la gente se de cuenta que lo que necesitamos no es un ""partido político"" sino políticos honestos que realmente quieran hacer que el pais avance."
3433,Porque es una falsa equivalencia.
3434,Por que es un tibio marica
3435,"Creo que es porque entonces caes en la casilla de los verdes y se asume que apoyas a Fajardo (No digo que lo hagas, estoy siguiendo la cadena de pensamientos que he visto), y pues a Fajardo mucha gente no le agrada por razones preexistentes o por el tema del voto en blanco. A mí me desagrada la comparación Petro/Uribe, se me hace bastante desacertada, Petro será todo lo mamerto radical que quieran y consejero de Chávez pero eso no es comparable a un warmonger como Uribe ligado a tanta historia del narcotráfico en el país y con tantos vínculos con narcos o wannabe narcos actuales. 

Lo que quiero decir es que Petro da mala espina con su radicalismo, zealot and caudillo behavior, y teorías económicas, pero no es comparable a seguirle dando el país a un ente criminal como Uribe. Si las cosas se reducen a Petro y al que diga Uribe otra vez la verdad me da menos miedo Petro que seguirle dando rienda suelta a Uribe."
3436,Simple papi nosotros tenemos la necesidad de ubicar a los demás en un grupo los de derecha te preguntan y dependiendo de como respondas te ubica en un lugar u otro incluso sin saber que significa la derecha o la izquierda el centro etc tenemos la nesesidad de ubicar al otro en un grupo para juzgarlo y la gente no piensa que los ideales de una persona pueden ser mucho mas que alguien de derecha o de izquierda en el caso de Colombia lo que dice la gente es que si eres de derecha tienes que amar a uribe y odiar a petro y viceversa pero las personas no miran mas halla de eso una for.a de juzgarte y saver donde ponerte
3437,"Realmente en las reuniones qué he visto de la gente de primeras lineas, dialogoa.facilitados por las Universidades por ejemplo en Bogotá y por otros canales, NO se plantea Petro Como una Solución, simplemente en algunos casos Como Una transición pero lo q más se repite, es la discusión y acuerdos entre movimientos vecinales para buscar acuerdos y Una sola voz, qué Haga las demandas Al presente gobierno. Tienen claro q el comité del Paro qué hay actualmente NO Los representa a Todos y tambien tienen clarísimo qué Los judicializarán cuando esto acabe, por eso buscan verdaderos cambios!"
3438,Porque esto no es un país es un partido de fútbol!
3439,Yo creo que petro es mas del monton pero anda decicelo aun petrista te tilda de ciudadano de vien y un idiota lo mismo los uribistas estar en el medio es ser pendejo segun ellos

3444,"¿Se crean criminales o nacen? ¿Cuál es la mejor manera de abordar el crimen? ¿Persiguiendo a los criminales que existen? ¿O impidiendo la creación de nuevos delincuentes? Idealmente ambos.

Los asesinatos no desaparecen porque se elige a un político de izquierda. Pero solo la izquierda tomará las acciones necesarias para evitar que se creen criminales a partir de circunstancias de pobreza. Asimismo, solo la izquierda abordará la brutalidad policial.

Es comprensible por qué la gente pensaría que si un ex guerrillera del M19 convierte en comandante en jefe de las fuerzas armadas daría como resultado un uso más justo de las fuerzas armadas cuando Petro ha estado al otro lado de ellos y policia en el pasado."
3445,"No papito, no salga con esas falsedades, nosotros no creemos que duque ""se los INVENTO"", nosotros sabemos que los asesinatos a lideres sociales ya ocurrian desde hace años, pero en el gobierno de duque se dispararon esponencialmente, y claro duque no los mata, ni es responsable indirectamente, es su patron Uribe quien en realidad manda y el o permite el asesinato de lideres sociales o si manda a grupos ya sea guerrila, bacrims y/narcos a matarlos, pueden ser muchos factores, ademas de eso en Colombia la constitucion el primer derecho es el de la vida, el gobierno esta en el deber de proteger a nuestros lideres sociales pero en este gobierno se nota un descuido y una negligencia por protegerlos.   
Estos lideres sociales que han muerto por ejemplo son quienes resguardan los paramos, ya sabes, gente que pone su vida para que no se las vendan a mineros y no te sepa el aguita a mierda..."

También me da cosa de que Petro se ponga todo nacionalista de izquierda y quiera enviar a los venecos de vuelta a Venezuela, si una cosa buena ha hecho Duque es ayudar a los venecos si quiera dándole la oportunidad a los bebés y niños de convertirse en ciudadanos y a la gente que trabaja les ha prometió un camino hacia la ciudadanía, mientras que Petro ha dicho cosas como “hay que ayudar a Venezuela para que los venezolanos vuelva a su país” y eso más estupido no puede ser, no importa cuánta ayuda le dé el gobierno de haya seguirá violando los derechos de las personas además que ese lugar está en ruinas."
3456,"A la gente no le gusta petro por que perteneció a un movimiento con ideologías de socialismo democrático, y era parte del grupo que atacó el palacio de justicia, por sus políticas keynesianas, por su amistad con Chávez etc."

Es aumentar el gasto público para activar  la economía."

Tenemos siglos de historia para respaldar eso. En muchos paises de Central-Nordic Europe no tienen politicos extremistas y estan muy bien.  Amo como ellos siempre logran encontrar el Balance entre la Derecha/**Centro/Izquierda**. El Resultado? Son los paises con los mejores estandares de vida en el planeta.

la historia de muchos países demuestra todo lo contrario."
3464,"Gracias por hacer ese comentario, y mostrar el perfecto ejemplo de lo que quería decir. Una mirada muy sesgada y desinformada del tema, tal como dije.

Durante Duque no se dispararon los asesinatos de líderes. Han tenido una tendencia irregular. Bajaron en el 2019, 10% (y no estoy citando fuentes de gobierno, sino a Indepaz) y subieron en 2020.

Lo de que Uribe es quien los mata ni siquiera merece comentario. Pero ya que menciona a Uribe, vale decir que durante su mandato fue cuando los asesinatos selectivos tuvieron un descenso más marcado.

Te voy a ser 100% sincero, no tengo idea de que es el Kynesianismo y aun asi tengo dudas de si Petro tiene estas ideas o no, pero estoy abierto a que me explique con fuentes para ver a Petro de forma distinta. 

\>Amistad con Chavez.

Uribe tambien se saco fotos con Chavez y tuvieron sus amistades, pero nadie recuerda eso, Petro ha dicho que en venezuela lo critican porque no es amigo del gobierno de Maduro, Diosdadocabellos ha criticado a Petro, y aqui hay un video de PEtro donde critica el gobierno de Venezuela.

Apoyo a Petro porque se que es el unico candidato que invertira en educacion, y Colombia necesita salir adelante a punta de gente educada, no mas ignorancia para el pueblo.

3474,"No soy ni Uribista ni petrista pero hombre cómo vas a decir semejante barbaridad,  decir que los asesinatos selectivos bajaron en el período de Uribe es muy triste, y seguro los falsos positivos fueron un invento de los campesinos. Hombre todo sabemos que Uribe y sus fieles perros son los padres de las autodefensas, lo saben todos los colombianos y hasta la comunidad internacional. Pueden intentar hacerle un lavado de cara a la imagen de los uribistas pero ya están muy quemados y si no han salido del poder es porque se aferran a el con violencia. plomo de parte de la ""gente de bien""."
3475,"Fajardo no es tibio, no se engañe, apuesto y aseguro con mi vida que Fajardo es Uribista."
3476,"Porque alguien que quiere liderar tiene que transmitir solidez y tener posiciones claras. Y han pasado muchos eventos en los últimos 4 años donde Fajardo se ha quedado callado ni ha emitido declaraciones rechazando o condenando cosas.

Antes me parecía centrado, ahora me parece sencillamente un agazapado que intenta mantener apariencias y quedarse callado para no disgustar a nadie y parecer la opción menos polarizante... Sin saber qué realmente representa esa opción menos polarizante."

3480,"Es como  criticar a Uribe por sus nexos con los paramilitares, pero decir que petro perteneció al m19 el cual tenía ideologías de socialismo democrático y decir no petro ya no es así. 

Obvio que Uribe es corrupto pero con petro no tienen ese mismo racionamiento. Por pertenecer a una de las guerrillas de Colombia que quemó el palacio de justicia puede que petro no estuviera en el ataque pero igual hacia parte de esa organización y por lo tanto es condenable.


https://youtu.be/hAx9cbpJCS0

En este vídeo  petro asiste al funeral de Chávez de no ser tan amigo no hubiera asistido, lo de Uribe con Chávez es más protocolo, es más se ha escuchado a petro decir que el error de Chávez solo fue depender del petróleo.


Lo de invertir más educación, y otros gastos que él quiere hacer suena muy bonito pero eso se paga con más impuestos, que tiene que pagar la gente del común que ahora está marchando por los impuestos.


Lo que no saben es que las empresas en Colombia son las que mayor carga de impuestos tienen en Latinoamérica. Por lo tanto si a las empresas les ponen muchos impuestos o se van o quiebran.

Y también más impuestos para la clase media 
Que no quiere pagar más impuestos


Otra cosa de petro es que cree mucho en imprimir dinero y eso crea inflación y pérdida del valor de la moneda."
3481,"Las empresas públicas se costean con nuestros impuestos con la plata que recogen de la gente, de las empresas y si tiene perdidas se mantiene con la plata del estado, aparte que quieren menos corrupción pero quieren más estado y burocracia."
3482,"Lo que es una completa estupidez, una completa imbecilidad y necedad es negar aquellos asesinatos bajaron considerablemente durante el Gobierno de Uribe cuando le estoy mostrando los datos. 

¿Usted sabe leer?"
3483,"No es necesario, eso lo sabe todo mundo, y sus seguidores, puro uribista de closet."
3484,"A ver lo que digo es que se puede replantear como gestionar una parte del presupuesto general de la nación que por cierto se aprobó el año pasado de más de 300 billones de pesos, para invertir en empresas públicas eso sí con veeduría y auditoría de las cuentas. Pero no se pueden robar los 50 billones ni tampoco dejar sin ejecutar parte de ese presupuesto, y viendo este gobierno pues esta claro que van a seguir mal gestionandolo todo."
3485,"Yo pienso que el estado es muy grande y eso permite la corrupción y petro quiere aumentar el estado y aumentar el gasto. lo qué propones sería bien pero estamos en Colombia, hay mucha corrupción, no confío en los politicos siempre se van a robar plata y si se pierde la plata por robo o se pierde la plata por que el negocio no funcionó perdemos todos, además con todos los gastos que va que tener que tomar el estado para que termine el paro y más la pandemia no se qué tanto quede para invertir, pero ya veremos qué pasa."
3486,"Bueno no se donde viste eso de Petro que quiere aumentar el estado, pues él y el sector alternativo piensan en eliminar muchos puestos públicos por ejemplo en los consulados del exterior y eliminar gastos como de camionetas para los congresistas y sus sueldos. Si hablas de reducir el congreso sería bueno siempre y cuando que procuren tener un total suficiente de representación ciudadana, eso debe ser debatido con calma. El gasto público puede ser alto pero eficiente, por ejemplo en países como Dinamarca que es como del 54% del PIB. El presidente puede ser Petro o cualquier alternativo pero lo importante es que el congreso que es el que debate las leyes sea la mayoría de los partidos independientes o de oposición actuales. Esperemos que el otro año cambie las cosas."
3487,Es bueno ver que aún hay personas en este sub que hablan sin insultos y generan debate educadamente. Felicitaciones chicos!
3488,"Estoy de acuerdo con la reducción de gastos inútiles, cargos inútiles y beneficios a políticos, deberían bajarse tantos puestos innecesarios y reducir el sueldo tan alto de senadores, representantes, montón de pensiones  que se pagan a expresidentes que ya son gente con dinero etc.


Ahora que el gasto público y el estado va ha aumentar eso es seguro, según su propuesta.

https://youtu.be/j-yUUIM7idU

En esta entrevista mencionaba su plan de gobierno para el 2018. Allí hay varios puntos en los que se va a aumentar el gasto al estado, crear más estado y subir más impuestos.

En Dinamarca hay políticos menos corruptos, además que pagan gran cantidad de impuestos."
3489,"El gasto público tiene que aumentar de manera transparente si o si, la falta de voluntad política ha precarizado la economía, salud, educación, etc. Yo se que en Dinamarca pagan muchos impuestos, pero yo estaba hablando del gasto público, acá podemos potenciar el agro porque tenemos muchas más tierras que ellos para producir y exportar alimentos. Y con no solo subir impuestos pero para grandes patrimonios y riquezas, hay que evitar la evasión, y eso sería un alivio para el recaudo tributario, podríamos crecer como nación sin duda si tenemos en cuenta los puntos que te digo.

Con el video no me simplificas el por qué quería tener más estado, algo que me llama la atención, porque ya te comenté que la oposición hoy por hoy buscan reducir mayormente los cargos públicos. 
Yo no soy de Petro pero no me parecería una locura si él llegara a ser presidente porque pues es de los que más estaría abierto al dialogo y consensos en estos aspectos fundamentales que he dicho, eso si, no hay que votar por los partidos que hoy son la mayoría en el congreso, eso es lo realmente importante."
3490,"El gasto público debería aumentar respectivamente con la capacidad del país, cómo sabe se cayó la reforma tributaria que iba a recaudar dinero para el gasto público,   si el gobierno se pone a imprimir dinero sería mal para la gente y aumentar la deuda pública peor.

Evasión siempre va haber, cuando hay personas que  tienen la capacidad de mirar y analizar los huecos legales, la subida de impuestos provoca la fuga de los capitales.

En el vídeo se comenta que se van a crear empleos directos con el Estado por sus propuestas de salud y educación.

Tampoco soy un fan de la reforma pensional que el propone.

Potenciar el agro está bien, pero yo pienso que este país debería tener más fácilidades para el emprendimiento y crear productos con valor agregado. No sólo quedarse en materias primas, se debería hacer más énfasis en el sector de servicios."

3496,Estoy en contra de la corrupción.
3497,"Pues habia prometido no volver a postear nada politico por temor a un ban lol pero solo una ultima vez....

Estoy en contra. Ambos lados no quieren solucionar nada-poner de su parte y si esto va para largo pues adios a Colombia como lo conocemos porque caera en una crisis economica mas grave de lo que causo el Covid-Las Reformas. Yo creo que la mejor manera de arreglar las cosas es votar por alguien que no sea del centro democratico o extremista en las siguientes elecciones que ya son pronto. Los extremos han creado cosas como bolsonaro-trump-chavez-amlo.

Contra los bloqueos de las carreteras estoy totalmente en contra porque quiebra a las personas que menos tienen. Quien le va a responder a todas esos cientos de familias del agro que perdieron todo en Cali y ahora no tienen como vivir?  quien le va a responder a todos los que tienen tiendas de ropa y dependen del traslado de sus mercancias? quien le va a responder a la señora que vendia empanadas y ahora por los precios esta quebrando??? Aqui los derechos de unos no valen mas que los otros. La lucha va contra los politicos no contra los congeneres. Al mismo tiempo como es que Duque hace nada por los camioneros? que le cuesta? un cerdo.

Lo de que Colombia esta mal no viene de duque unicamente. Esto es de decadas y hasta ahora hizo ignicion. Yo no recuerdo que Colombia estuviera muy bien cuando estaban pastrana-samper. La Mezcla de los Politicos de Derecha y las Farc por decadas han llevado al pais a la ruina. Tambien no debemos ignorar que el mayor problema esta en varios de los Congresistas-Senadores-Las Cortes de este pais.....

Lo de las marchas es totalmente valido porque el pais esta muy abandonado y Uribe-Santos-Duque lo desangraron de una manera monstruosa favoreciendo solo a sus amigos ricos por años. Por otro lado hay ciertas personas en esas marchas con objetivos netamente de sembrar una Colombia comunista y algunos pagados por guerrillas-eln. Lo digo porque sigo bastantes del paro en redes sociales y tengo ~~familiares envueltos en eso.....~~

En twitter me han atacado ambos lados de la manera mas violenta asi que no quiero saber de ninguno de los 2. Horrible como el extremismo de Derecha-Izquierda se le mete a las personas. Tambien es un asco como Uribe-Petro han ayudado a incendiar el pais en vez de apagar las llamas. Que les suspendan los twitters. Tambien al ministro de defensa y bolivar.

Solo quiero que esto se detenga y se acabe el covid y Colombia de alguna forma mejore. Extraño la vida de antes que aunque era un desastre pues........ Colombia es un pais con cosas muy bellas yo no lo quiero abandonar."
3498,"Me siento neutral. Tiene cosas buenas, tiene cosas malas. Me gusta la oposición al Uribismo, pero no me gusta la falta de orden o de ideas claras, realistas y articuladas por parte de los manifestantes. Tampoco siento que el paro tenga un propósito consecuente y claro en este momento, y muchas veces se siente que sigue más por momentum que por logros reales o concretos (obviamente en gran medida por culpa de un gobierno de mierda, pero también en parte por ser un movimiento descentralizado y a veces ambiguo). 

Es incómodo intentar trabajar y comer en un país en paro, pero más incómodo es hacerse el pendejo a las verdades de este país, por eso no critico a los que paran. Yo necesito trabajar y el paro sí me ha afectado negativamente, no voy a mentir. Pero no es como que hacerse el ciego y creer en el gobierno más mediocre e incompetente que he visto en mi vida sea una solución realista. 

No puedo marchar, tengo que seguir trabajando (hay que comer), y además me gusta mi trabajo. Me niego a darle la razón al gobierno que está matando gente en las calles, pero no veo avances de ninguna manera con el paro, y parece que mientras no haya figuras de liderazgo fuertes que organicen la cosa, no va a llegar a nada. El paro necesita líderes, estrategas y personas con el poder de unir y convocar. La masa no logrará mucho así."
3499,Apenas ocho votos 😅. Yo creo que las manifestaciones se pueden juzgar separadas del paro y de sus versiones en diferentes ciudades. No es lo mismo quejarse de los efectos de algo en Cali que en Medellín no tiene los mismos efectos
3500,"Una buena parte del problema es que dependamos tanto de las carreteras.

Al país le falta una infraestructura ferroviaria, que debido a las cordilleras no es nada sencilla de hacer, pero tampoco imposible.

Es increíble que tantas cosas se dupliquen o tripliquen en costo debido a que tienen que ser cargadas en tractomula por sinuosas y peligrosas carreteras, y esto seguirá siendo cierto cuando se acabe el paro.

En Colombia todo es caro, hasta lo que se produce aquí mismo, y la dificultad del transporte debería ser la principal preocupación de los próximos 5 gobiernos."
3501,"Samper fue un cáncer para Colombia, cuando llegó el desempleo era del 7% y cuando salió fue del 16%, Pastrana lo dejó en 19% y Uribe lo bajó al 11%, Santos lo alcazó a tener en 9% un año pero con la pandemia se subío al 15%.

Hay muchas mas cifras para debatir y que si estudia quedará mas uribista que uribe."
3502,"Gracias por esa opinion tan significativa. desconocia eso.   
Habia leido que los camioneros tienen como un **tipo de monopolio** y por eso en Colombia no tenemos casi trenes. Es eso cierto?  
Pero si ponemos vias ferroviarias no se irian todos a la calle? que se haria ahi? eso me parece bastante terrible.   


Yo estudiaba por el norte de Bogota y siempre veia pasar el tren ❤️ Love them.  


El otro dia estaba checando google maps en 3D y seriamente Colombia es un infierno topograficamente. Tiene unas montañas enormes y casi todo esta bloqueado por elevaciones."
3503,">Hay muchas mas cifras para debatir y que si estudia quedará mas uribista que uribe.

Bajo Uribe el desempleo ""bajó"" sólo si se toma en cuenta la informalidad, que creció en gran medida bajo su gobierno y que en muchísimos casos no alcanzaba (ni alcanza) el salario mínimo.  La industria manufacturera y el comercio bajo Uribe *decrecieron* 6.3% y 2.9%, casi todo el crecimiento económico ocurrió en la extracción de petróleo y la minería por parte de extranjeros. La desigualdad durante esa gestión también incrementó, llegando a posicionar a Colombia como el quinto país más desigual del mundo."
3504,"No necesariamente es por el monopolio de los camioneros.

El terreno es difícil, esa es la principal razón.

Y pues para comprar un camión se necesitan unos cientos de millones de pesos y se pone a trabajar.

Mientras que para invertir en vías férreas se necesita mil o diez mil veces más dinero, coordinación y poca corrupción.

Es más bien que hacemos lo que podemos, cada uno a su manera, cuidando sus propios intereses, pero a la hora de organizarnos nada."

El esta pensando en irse para canada-bogota-la costa tiene buen curriculum y contactos........Los trabajadores de esas empresas? a mirar como buscan trabajo en medio de una crisis traida por pandemia  en una ciudad casi destruida (Cali) y seguro tienen varios hijos que alimentar.

Tambien de acuerdo con que el paro destruyo la reputacion del centro democratico. Esto fue como el maximo golpe para Uribe.

3522,"Le puedo empezar por responder desde lo que sé sobre la Ley 100 y sus efectos. Toda Colombia fue muy afectada, positivamente. Permitió aumentar el gasto público en salud; incentivó la inversión privada en el sistema; tuvo un impacto social significativo, cerrando la brecha en el uso del servicio de salud; promovió la protección financiera del sistema lo que ha permitido cubrir enfermedades de alto costo; la cobertura en salud creció muy significativamente; el gasto de bolsillo en   
 salud de los colombianos actualmente es de los más bajos en América Latina.En esa época la esperanza de vida en Colombia era como de 63 años, hoy en día es de 79 años. Muchos otros indicadores de salud del país demuestran un impacto muy positivo.

Con respecto a su segunda pregunta, es mucho más complicada la respuesta porque ambos proyectos de reforma tenían muchos puntos, sobre todos se podía discutir su conveniencia o no. Por ejemplo Claudia López alabó recientemente varios puntos de la reforma tributaria que se cayó.

Su tercera pregunta es una pregunta capciosa.

La cuarta pregunta, los más beneficiados fueron mipymes que pudieron cubrir diversos gastos de seguridad social, por ejemplo. Esas pequeñas y medianas empresas constituyen la gran mayoría de las empresas del país. Y también la gente que recibió subsidios directos.

La quinta pregunta me hace entrever que usted no tiene claro cuáles son las funciones del Banco de la República, y que está hablando por hablar en ese caso. Habla del BRC como si fuera un banco privado y, nada que ver.

Sobre la sexta pregunta, no sé, dígamelo usted. Lo cierto es que los organismos de DDHH como Human Rights Watch no han comprado el cuento de los grupos de manifestantes que han querido vender la idea de que Colombia es una ""narcodictadura"" y han dicho que apoyan y esperan que el Gobierno colombiano investigue y castigue los abusos policiales."

Tengo varios familiares uribistas que les parecio tan abusivo lo de las reformas que pensaban hasta salir a la calle. Aunque muchos no lo crean hasta los Uribistas estaban contra esa cosa pero las personas no salieron por el problema del **covid-19**. Tambien a varios les enojo que duque no hiciera nada con lo de los paros por tanto tiempo (osea militarizar-conmocion interior)  y ya no creen que los candidatos de Uribe sean aptos para el pais porque todos les salen Judas (Esto lo vi en twitter)  Su partido esta quemandose.

¿De qué está hablando? Con esa frase estaba haciendo referencia a las peticiones del Comité del paro, ninguna de las cuales tiene que ver con reabrir la frontera.

La segunda frase que cita hace parte de otro párrafo y de otra discusión, y además también la sacó de contexto y no hace referencia al cierre de la frontera, sino al hecho de que usted dijo que había que desarrollar el comercio con Venezuela y hacer regresar a los venezolanos a su país (con lo cual se contradice con respecto a lo de reabrir la frontera). Yo sí creo que la frontera debe estar abierta, Duque la cerró por la pandemia, Maduro la ha hecho cerrar varias veces. Pero dinamizar el comercio con Venezuela depende de que exista una economía en Venezuela, y esta cada vez se contrae más y más.

En ese mismo hilo hizo lo mismo, sacando de contexto y tergiversando varias cosas que dije. Le respondí de vuelta, lo refuté, y no respondió más. Aquí está la discusión: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Colombia/comments/n9lvzj/seguimos\_en\_pie\_de\_lucha/gxt501a/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Colombia/comments/n9lvzj/seguimos_en_pie_de_lucha/gxt501a/?context=3)

>Ahora resulta ser que el gobierno anunció que va a abrir las fronteras con Venezuela aplicando normas de bioseguridad. O sea, mágicamente después del paro desaparecieron todos los riesgos por COVID que mantuvieron dichas fronteras cerradas por más de un año

O de pronto ahora el Gobierno tiene una capacidad de hacer testeos mucho mayor que la que tenía hace un año, por ejemplo? Además de haber negociado y asegurado más de 70 millones de vacunas.  
  


>La realidad es que el gobierno empieza a mostrar su desespero porque sabe que tiene que reactivar la economía a como dé lugar y especialmente en Cúcuta,

O de pronto ese es el trabajo del gobierno? Intentar dinamizar y reactivar la economía, y buscar un equilibrio entre actividad económica y salud.

>la situación del gobierno es particularmente débil porque se quedó sin las cartas de acusar al gobierno venezolano de reprimir la protesta pacífica.

¿? Lo siento, Chávez, pero no. Los abusos de DDHH en Venezuela no dejan de existir en razón de lo que suceda en Colombia. Igual Colombia está en la OEA y en otros organismos, y eso la obliga a tomar parte en las denuncias y medidas contra esos abusos, de la misma forma que tiene que responder por los abusos aquí.

Lo que cita de Maduro no demuestra que tenga ninguna sartén por el mango, demuestra que Venezuela también cerró su frontera, contrario a lo que usted decía.

Mirando en su historial de posts también miré por encima y descubrí otras estupideces que dijo en otras discusiones, como que ""la reforma tributaria se aprueba al todo o nada"" (completamente falso)."
3590,"Esté abierta o cerrada la frontera con Venezuela, es lo mismo. Aunque cerrada es más peligroso en general, te lo dice alguien que ha vivido toda su vida ahí."
3591,"Se le olvida que ahorita en la frontera está una de nose cuantas disidencias de las FARC dándose palo con el ejército venezolano al tal punto que casi toda la gente de un pueblo venezolano se tuvo que venir aca, no lose Rick, eso no da ganas de abrir la frontera"
3592,"Hola. No entiendo por qué la molestia, si incluso tuve la gentileza de hacer una mención a u usuario para que estuvieras al tanto de lo que publiqué. 

En realidad no tengo ganas de discutir contigo. Creo que tenemos distintas interpretaciones de la discusión y, sin ánimo de ofender, no creo que estés discutiendo de buena fe. Yo literalmente inicié mi argumento con la siguiente frase:

>... debería Duque, por ejemplo, dejar de pendejear con lo de Maduro y los derechos humanos y abrir la frontera para que se dinamice el comercio con Venezuela... Nada más por ahí tienes cientos de millones de dólares para empezar a cerrar la brecha fiscal. 

Luego mencioné un conjunto de acciones que **yo** considero pudieran ayudar a recaudar fondos distintas a las que aparecían en la reforma tributaria original incluyendo - y esta es una idea enteramente propia, basada en evidencia y que mal pudiera yo endilgársela al Comité del Paro - de legalizar el cannabis e imponer fuertes tributos a su consumo y comercialización. 

Culminé la lista señalando que:

>El Estado tiene herramientas a su disposición para hacer frente a la crisis. 

**Unas herramientas que claramente partieron de mí - /u/Beginning_Beginning - no del Comité del Paro**. ¿Qué carajos iba a saber yo (o cualquiera de nosotros si a ver vamos) cuáles eran esas propuestas en ese momento? Y sin embargo tú empezaste a responder cada uno de **mis** puntos: ""impuesto a las bebidas azucaradas, puede ser, puede que no...""; ""medidas y proyectos en curso para reducir los gastos de funcionamiento del Estado ya hay varias...""; ""lo de impulsar el comercio con Venezuela no tiene sentido..."", y culminaste escribiendo que ""en general no hay razón para que el Gobierno 'conceda' así como así ninguno de esos puntos. Son cosas que requerirían muchísimo más debate y deliberación"".

Seamos serios por favor. ¿Ahora resulta ser tú estabas era respondiendo los puntos del Comité del Paro? ¿De dónde salió eso y cómo alguien podría saberlo?

Tú expusiste las razones por las cuáles lo de impulsar el comercio con Venezuela no tenía sentido, yo expliqué por qué tu razonamiento era errado y tú contra-argumentaste señalando razones adicionales. Es todo parte del mismo hilo de discusión. Estoy al tanto de la frase ""Obvio que yo creo que debe estar abierta"" pero ello no concuerda con la idea de que ""impulsar el comercio con Venezuela no tiene sentido"" cuando yo enlacé no una sino cuatro fuentes de empresarios colombianos solicitando apoyo al ejecutivo a lo largo de un año para que se abriera la frontera y así impulsar el comercio con Venezuela. Ya ahí no había más que responder, tú hiciste un comentario basado en suposiciones personales que no se sostienen a la luz de los hechos (y a la final tuve yo la razón, Duque abrió la frontera). 

Con respecto a lo demás no voy a comentar. Guarda esta conversación y revísala periódicamente cuando veas lo que va a pasar con Guaidó, con las elecciones de alcaldes y gobernadores en Venezuela, con la bajada de tono de las acusaciones de Colombia hacia Venezuela y el cambio de actitud del grupo de Chile, con la mejora del comercio binacional luego de que el gobierno colombiano se vea obligado a negociar de tú a tú con Maduro y se le olvide el gobierno interino y toda el cuento de los derechos humanos (que Colombia también se pasa por el forro).

A la final a los hechos no les importan los comentarios formulados en Reddit por un par de desconocidos."
3593,"Lo ideal dicta que un gobierno debería tomar las mejores decisiones para garantizar el bienestar de los pobladores. 

Una visión más pragmática (más cínica, aunque más ajustada a nuestras realidades) es que un gobierno debería tomar las mejores decisiones que le permitan mantenerse en el poder, lo cual uno esperaría que implique garantizar el bienestar de los pobladores para que estos los vuelvan a votar en las siguientes elecciones.  

La gente que ha leído este post y le ha hecho downvotes quizás no se ha dado cuenta de que, la ineptitud de Duque es porque no ha sabido tomar decisiones adecuadas, por ejemplo en materia de COVID (el bienestar de las personas), pero aún si no le importase el bienestar de las personas, más importante aún es que no ha tomado las decisiones adecuadas que debería haber tomado si quiere mantenerse en el poder. 

Puede que estando la frontera abierta o cerrada con Venezuela sea lo mismo, pero la percepción de la gente vale muchísimo y hay cosas que son indudables: uno, que Cúcuta está vuelta mierda y el cierre de frontera le dio durísmo; dos, que la gente de Cúcuta lleva un año rogándole a Duque porque abra la frontera; tres, que el Norte de Santander es crucial en el plan electoral del Centro Democrático para las elecciones del 2022; cuatro, que el gobierno así lo reconoce y - a pesar de haber dicho lo contrario hace apenas un mes cuando Duque ""definitivamente descartó esta posibilidad"" - le tocó volver a abrir la frontera; cinco, que lo hace desde una posición débil, con una imagen internacional seriamente opacada, pero negándose a negociar con Venezuela y apoyando a un gobierno paralelo venezolano que la Unión Europea dejó de reconocer en enero. 

De paso, está contra el tiempo en bajar las tensiones y reactivar la economía porque aún no ha acabado el paro y mientras tanto está tratando de mejorar la imagen del país y sacar una nueva reforma tributaria que tiene que pasar sí o sí y pronto, porque si no Fitch y Moody's también van a calificar la deuda colombiana como BBB- lo cual sería fatal. Para rematar, estamos en medio de un tercer pico de pandemia que está matando a 500 colombianos todos los días y que de repente obliga otra vez a cerrar los pasos por concepto de cuarentena (con todo y que ya ni nos acordemos). 

Esa es la realidad, yo no entiendo qué es tan difícil de aceptar. Como le dije al otro usuario: guarde este post y veremos cuál va a ser la actitud del gobierno de Duque frente al de Maduro en los meses por venir, vamos a ver cómo evoluciona el conflicto venezolano este año electoral, vamos a ver cómo Guaidó sale como corcho de limonada."

Los downvotes a menudo ocurren porque a la mayoría de cuentas en este sub no les gusta leer posts de las fronteras, Cúcuta, Catatumbo o Norte de Santander cuando el autor es diferente a un extranjero.

3626,"No es un buen tratado, empezando por que ignoraron los resultados del plebiscito, siguiendo con que se añadieron escaños a ex miembros de las FARC, no fueron elegidos democráticamente y la creación de nuevos puestos públicos implica el aumento del gasto público que se traduce en más impuestos, entonces aparte de recibir amnistía a pesar de ser literalmente CRIMINALES DE GUERRA acorde a la ley internacional, reciben dinero del contribuyente Colombiano al cuál saquearon asesinaron desaparecieron y contra el cual atentaron innumerables veces y encima mienten sobre lo que hicieron y encubren sus crímenes, pero obvio ganamos 100% porque ""la paz es buena sólo por existir"""
3627,"Una supuesta defensa de la democracia no puede servir como pretexto para argumentar que ""nadie los votó"", ese moralismo nadie se lo cree. Claramente nadie los votó porque son rebeldes, no participan en la vida civil. Así como un líder indígena o uno afrocolombiano difícilmente lograrían representación en el senado sin escaños especiales para ellos (como dice la Constitución que debe ser), a un exguerrillero también se le debe garantizar la participación si se reconoce que las causas de la sublevación eran legítimas (las cuales lo son, el hecho de que se haya implementado el Acuerdo de Paz demuestra que el Estado reconoce que las causas de las Farc eran legítimas). En ese sentido, la representación de las Farc en el Congreso es más comparable al de las minorías étnicas que a las de un parlamentario cualquiera en virtud de que reconocemos que fueron un grupo oprimido y por tal motivo deben tener representación especial, por aquello de garantizar la ""no repetición"".

Pasó lo mismo en Irlanda, en España con el ETA, en Uruguay con los Tupamaros (grupo al que perteneció Pepe Mujica) pero solo en este país tenemos la tara mental de pensar que los guerrilleros no pertenecen a la sociedad o que aparecieron porque sí, puestos a dedo por un dios malo porque sí, que los malos eran los campesinos de Marquetalia.

Los crímenes de guerra fueron hechos por el oficialismo (que aún sigue en el poder) y de eso hay amplias pruebas a nivel nacional e internacional pero por ellos sí no se escandalizan porque se ven decentes, estudiaron afuera y son, en términos generales, más lindos que los guerrilleros."
3628,"Es una falta de respeto comparar a líderes sociales y a minorías étnicas en su amplia mayoría pacíficas a traidores violentos, criminales culpables del asesinato de Miles de civiles, los crímenes perpetrados por las farc son más comparables a aquellos de los nazis en el frente occidental que a la consecuencia de alguna pelea idealista, además independientemente de que tuvieran ideales puros o de qué se les haya oprimido en un pasado distante lo que hicieron no se puede borrar, sólo un porque un grupo haya Sido oprimido en el pasado no significa que los crímenes y atrocidades que cometan están justificadas.

No parece justo parar una guerra sin consentimiento popular, no parece justo permitir que criminales de guerra tengan puestos de poder sin elecciones y tampoco parece justo que aquellos que les pagan el sueldo sean los mismos a los que atormentaron desde hace años.

Todos los insurgentes tienen buenas intenciones no significa que sus actos se justifiquen automáticamente ni que se les deba reconocer o premiar de ninguna forma.

Los crímenes de guerra del oficialismo si bien existieron fueron ampliamente casos aislados, no un modus operandi como lo fue con las farc, la principal fuente de reclutamiento de las farc era casi exclusivamente el secuestro de niños campesinos, eso ya es un crímen de guerra según el estatuto de Roma así como la toma de rehenes (práctica común entre las farc)  Así cómo atentados a la población civil o bienes civiles, el desplazamiento forzado y la instalación de minas antipersonales en áreas civiles, también son crímenes la ejecución de rehenes y prisioneros, la tortura de prisioneros y tratos degradantes hacia ellos. Esta es solo una fracción de los crímenes que han cometido estos traidores aunque por poco y violan todos los estatutos"

3631,Ahora vamos por la reforma policial
3632,"Entiendo su descontento y lo comparto, vivimos en un país con muchos desafíos y dificultades. También es cierto que tenemos una clase política cuyo objetivo de enriquecer sus círculos prima sobre el bienestar general (tanto el gobierno y la oposición). Sin embargo, la economía sólo es una y un país próspero  tiene que ser rico. El esfuerzo fiscal por la pandemia se ha notado. Si bien Colombia tiene solidez en cuanto sus recursos primarios, no tenemos las condiciones para depender de ese sector. El paro ha puesto en relieve la necesidad de aliviar las cargas al ciudadano de a pie, sin embargo, ha gestado un descontento en otros sectores, las riquezas de los países dependen de la solidez de su sector privado. 

El cambio debe verse en las urnas, voten por expertos, gestores y buenos administradores, no se dejen llevar por el discurso populista, además recuerden que un países está compuesto por diferentes factores de poder, los cuales a través del consenso deben alinearse. 

Esta sólo es la opinión de un joven especialista en Derecho Público sin filiación política pero con mucho cariño por su país y su gente. 

Cuídense, un abrazo"

Se han registrado 4.399 concentraciones, 1.808 marchas y 2.151 bloqueos

Se han registrado 8.839 manifestaciones, 7.801 pacíficas y 1.038 con disturbios

Han muerto 26 civiles, 15 «relacionados con la protesta» y 11 «en proceso de clarificación y determinación si han sido en el marco de la protesta»

Ha muerto 1 policía

Se reportan 1.025 civiles lesionados en «ciudades como Bogotá, Cali, Yumbo, Neiva, Medellín, Pasto y Popayán, y otros municipios de Risaralda y Valle del Cauca».

Se reportan 1.021 «uniformados» lesionados, de los cuales 6 siguen hospitalizados.

Se han realizado 822 capturas en flagrancia y 57 capturas por requerimiento judicial

&#x200B;

Quiero resaltar 1021 uniformados heridos, cuéntame como es que la policía es la que esta matando si tiene casi la misma cantidad de heridos. Es mas de 4399 concentraciones, solo 1025 civiles heridos, eso es menos que la feria de las flores que con 7 desfiles hay 3 muertos.

3637,"Confirmo, vi personas manifestandose en algunos barrios del sur en Bogotá."
3638,"Yo no estoy de acuerdo con los bloqueos de carreteras. Afectan millones de personas. Si eres privilegiado y no te pasa nada no significa que no le este ocurriendo a otros en el pais. Todos los struggles son importantes. Una gran cantidad de empresas con cientos de empleados estan a punto de irse a la bancarrota. Esas Familias importan y Perder empresas en un pais es irse a la ruina economica. En muchas ciudades hay desabastecimiento de muchas cosas. Una minima subida de los precios en todo puede afectar negocios enteros y hasta a la señora que vende las empanaditas-almuerzos. Aqui en mi ciudad hasta tenian problema con los pacientes renales por falta de medicamentos. Te imaginas tu mama estuviera ahi?  Aun asi entiendo a a los camioneros porque el gobierno lleva años abusando con los Peajes. Aqui duque es el que deberia hablar con ellos y darles soluciones. Llevamos 20 dias? y nada se soluciona..... lo que es grave. A duque le importan 0 las empresas prefiere hablar con fajardo,politicos de altas esferas o de la Copa America. Un presidente serio hace algo pero no deja que esto vaya tan lejos. Yo fuera el presidente andaria en reuniones todo el dia-todos los dias con ellos hasta llegar a algo.

Si duque hubiera sido menos soberbio y menos desconectado de la dura realidad del pais esto no habria pasado. El vive en una burbuja donde todo esta bien. Es tan solo ver ese programa que llevaba por meses y a nadie en el pais le servia pero el seguia porque queria su talk show. El tipo tendra estudios pero es un bruto bruto. Le falta humildad. Le falto escuchar a las personas y no solo sus amigos politicos.

Si las personas marchan deben hacerlo como estan haciendo en Bogota que cambian de lugar llevando awareness a todo lado. En ibague se dedicaron a quedarse en un solo espacio y estan afectando terriblemente todos los negocios aleñados. Aqui el gobierno no sufre son las personas porque a duque le vale \*\*\*\*. Tambien las marchas deberian enfocarse donde viven los politicos ricos? entes gubernamentales?

Mis respetos a los que marchan que mantienen el distanciamiento-tapabocas. Shame a los que se lo quitan y se ponen a hacer reunion social poniendo en riesgo la vida de sus padres-hermanos-tios. Hay que ser muy ignorantes para no tomar este virus en serio en especial ahora que no tenemos UCIs.

Los del Esmad-Policia deberian quedarse en sus casas por 2 semanas. No Salir. Si los estan enviando a matar ellos deberian decir NO. Asi se acabaran las muertes. La marcha es pacifica entonces supongo no veremos ningun problema.....  Ellos tienen que no dejar que el matarife los use como carne para sus planes. Estoy de acuerdo en que se necesita una Reforma y no solo aqui en Colombia.

No debemos olvidar que Duque no es el unico culpable de esto. Santos-Uribe-Pastrana-Samper-El Congreso-Las Farc-Billonarios Colombianos.......Aqui son varios que tienen al pais en ruinas desde hace varios años. Todo el batch de politicos ricos-familias ricas  en Colombia son culpables de esto. El Olvido a los campesinos-estrato bajos-medios-educacion-comunidades afro......"

Además el tamaño de las protestas es mucho menos importante que las propuestas que han salido del mismo, que, a mi parecer, hasta el momento, son muy pobres y muy poco aterrizadas.

¿Logros del paro? Que se cayeron los proyectos de reforma tributaria y de salud... bueno, eso es sólo parcialmente cierto porque igual ya estaban casi desplomados por falta de apoyo en las bancadas del Congreso. El tema de la matrícula cero creo que estaba contemplado en la reforma que se cayó."

3650,"La vaina es que la reforma a la salud profundizaba en el tratamiento de los pacientes como si fueran clientes, restringiendo el acceso a la salud a aquellos con dinero y a aquellos dispuestos a endeudarse.

2) Claro que duelen los muertos por COVID, pero mas que las concentraciones de gente lo que mata es el desastrosos sistema de salud, donde los pobres no reciben atención y los centros de salud no tienen recursos para invertir en prevención. Ni el mejor ni el peor gobierno pudieron haber respondido a esta crisis porque fueron mas de 20 años de ley 100 acabando con la calidad del sistema de salud. Si no fuera por las politicas impulsadas por la ultra derecha colombiana, ciertamente hubieran habido mas UCI para atender a las personas. 

3) Sobre las cifras de policias heridos, se de primera mano que cuando los afectan gravemente sus propios gases lacrimogenos pasan las cifras de heridos. Lo mismo que en el Hotel que incendiaron, no fue a proposito, fue un mal manejo de las armas que usaban para inculpar a los manifestantes los que causaron dicho incendio y las lesiones relacionadas. Sumele los infiltrados heridos por sus propios compañeros. Los culpables de dichas lesiones no son los manifestantes, los culpables de dichas lesiones son un gobierno indolente que se ha negado a hablar con la gente desde el día 1 y hoy se les salio el país de las manos. La gente protestando esta haciendo justicia, los policias su trabajo, los ricos estan haciendo el país añicos."
3661,">y bajemos del poder a esa clase puerca que nos ha gobernado por 200 años

Eso no tiene sentido. Los problemas de Colombia son estructurales, cambiar a las personas al mando o que llegue un mesías que pretende arreglarlo todo, no va a cambiar de fondo las cosas.

Además de que es una frase sin ningún rigor histórico, suena bien (para ustedes) pero no explica la realidad y complejidad histórica y política del país de 200 años."
3662,"Lo que necesitamos urgente es reforma el congreso. Esos son los verdaderos cerdos. Son los que aprueban las leyes que benefician a los ricos y que no ayudan a los pobres o clase media.

Y no solo marchar, sino movilizarse. Aqui desde Reddit podemos mover cosas, se me ocurre hacer un megathread con todos los mejores memes en contra de este gobierno y sobre el paro.  
La cosa es que acá hay muchos extranjeros y no podemos dejar que en este espacio quede la imagen que las cosas van mal, cuando no es así."

3668,Guat? Para usted todo el que esté apoyando el paro es comunista del foro de Sao Paulo. LOL
3669,De acuerdo. Los bloqueos están afectando especialmente a la clase media. Apoyo profundamente las demandas del paro pero creo que debe haber un límite en lo que consideramos como una protesta legítima.

El otro día publique un post para generar debate de una ONG que dice, con referencias las protestas son creadas por los Castro chavistas, y esa publicación tenía unas fuentes mucho más creíbles que tú post de facebook, debo creerle también? Creo que yo me quedo con un medio internacional independiente como CNN.

Según el WEF Colombia tiene el segundo mejor sistema de salud de la región. Puesto 16 a nivel mundial. Lo siento pero si bien falta mejorar, el sistema de salud colombiano no es el problema. No le creas todo lo que dicen los políticos.

Los gases lacrimógenos rara vez se consideran una herida, en la mayoría de casos no pasa de ser una quemadura de primer grado. Las heridas de los policías son por falta de entrenamiento y agrecision con piedras y otros elementos, o se te olvidó que hace unos días quemaron con cóctel Molotov a un grupo del ESMAD, si las protestas son pacíficas para que llevan un cóctel Molotov?

El tema de los infiltrados me da mucha risa, sabes para que meten infiltrados la policía a las protestas? Para identificar a los vandalos aprovechados que solo quieren generar disturbios, porque recuerda hay gente que solo quiere ver el mundo arder, y hay gente a la que le conviene que se mueran 400000 gallinas, que el precio de la comida se duplique y que las industrias entren en crisis, cuentame quien se beneficia de una situación como está, y creo que ya sabes que pasa, porque a la fecha el gobierno ha hecho todo lo que los protestantes piden y cada día salen con algo nuevo."

También comentó sobre otros puntos pero siendo sincero no presté mucha atención al resto."
3688,"Lo siento pero ese infome  
1) Es previo a la pandemia  
2) No tiene en cuenta prevención como parte de un sistema de salud (así que en Col. tenemos practicamente el mismo nivel que CHina, según el informe)

Ahora es aún más fuerte, con más médicos, mayor cantidad de camas y espacios habilitados, o crees que los hospitales y edificaciones que invirtieron simplemente se desaparecieron o van a desaparecer al finalizar la pandemia?

La prevención era uno de los puntos principales de la reforma a la salud, que los protestantes tumbaron. Si había otros puntos terribles, pero este central es interesante que vuelva."

No solo porque ya lleva casi el triple de duración que tenia en la toma de ese dato, sino porque también solo representa las perdidas en ventas que estiman los comerciantes, es decir no tiene en cuenta los daños a bienes públicos que también hay que pagar. Por ejemplo, solo en Bogotá se tendrán que gastar mas de 20.000 millones en reparar el Transmilenio nada mas, y eso sin contar la posibilidad que en los siguientes días sigan vandalizando el sistema^(1).

3723,"La verdad, tocaría o hacerle caso a la cifra estimada por presidencia (8.2 Billones de pesos^(1)), o ponerse a buscar entre todas las noticias cuanto estima cada alcaldía que le va a costar cada reparación (Yo calculo que son como mínimo 2.5 Billones de pesos si hacemos regla de 3 con los datos de Fenalco y sumamos los arreglos de los CAIs con el Transmilenio de Bogotá y el MIO de Cali, sin embargo no tengo en cuenta los daños en otras ciudades del pais.)

3726,"Buscando más información, me encontré el Balance General de la Nación de 2018, que no tiene una cifra concreta sobre corrupción, pero en la sección de dictamen están los montos de incorrecciones en la auditoría hecha y son cifras que bien le hacen pensar a uno que el estimado no es tan descabellado. Por ejemplo: hallazgos de 42,3 billones en los activos o hallazgos por 20.5 billones en el patrimonio.

Ojo, las incorreciones no significan que sean necesariamente corrupción.

3727,"No sé si te refieres al mismo documento de la CGN que estoy pensando, pero como tú dices no todos los montos que presentan ahí son concretamente corrupción, muchos son sobrecostos asociados a obras públicas, y esos montos corresponden si no estoy mal a un periodo como de 8 años. 50 billones anuales en corrupción es una cifra desmedida, para contrastar, el presupuesto anual del país es como de 300 billones"
3728,"No soy experto en la materia, pero entiendo que el informe es por el 2018, creo que en presupuesto de la nación que indican ahí es de cerca de 840 billones y lo que mencioné en el comentario anterior era solo a modo de ejemplo, porque hay otros dos hallazgos de 66 billones y 15 billones, pero no los mencioné porque no entendí muy bien de qué eran"
3729,"Que se halla presentado en 2018 no significa que todos los eventos ocurrieran en ese año (a menos que sea documento distinto al que me refiero, se habla del periodo 2014-2018). El pgn para 2021 es de 320 billones, decir que hay hallazgos de 66 billones es como decir que prácticamente se desapareció todo el presupuesto destinado a educación o a salúd.

Aquellos que apoyan los disturbios también etiquetarán a los alborotadores como manifestantes pacíficos para ganar simpatía por un grupo de vigalantes violentos.

No sé qué está sucediendo en este video exacto. Pero el alcalde ha estado en diálogo abierto con los manifestantes pacíficos. Sin embargo, 5 personas que fueron a la comisaría le prendieron fuego. La policía y los ciudadanos que se oponen al incendio de su ciudad se enzarzaron en una confrontación con estos vándalos. El alcalde alega que las mismas 5 personas fueron a su casa y lo amenazaron.

Es genial decir ""fuck the police"". Pero si crees que tener un grupo violento de vigalantes que quieren incendiar la ciudad y matar a todos los que discrepar con ellos (incluidos los funcionarios electos que simpatizan con los manifestantes) es de alguna manera mejor que la policía a cargo), estás loco.

3739,"Lo que esta pasando en Colombia no es la protesta contra la reforma tributaria. No son protestas organizadas por algún partido político,  el movimiento político espontáneo, sin una estructura vertical, sin una estructura en red tradicional. Son movimientos espontáneos. 

Porque parece difícil? Porque la gente no está protestando por una problema, está protestando por todos los problemas que han tenido y que han sido desatendidos durante décadas. Hay quienes protestan por temas estructurales otros protestan por temas locales. 

Debe haber una reforma Fiscal y Política. 
Que se acaben esas pensiones multimillonarias del Ejecutivo y el Legislativo. No más pensiones a ministros, presidentes y congresistas. 

La corrupción en Colombia debe ser sancionada con medidas más severas. La precariedad estructural (vías, salud, educación) se debe a la plata que se ha llevado la corrupción. 

El voto en Colombia debe ser obligatorio. La abstención es funcional para la politiquería de siempre. En Colombia la política no funciona haciendo las mejores propuestas para convencer a la mayoría, en Colombia la política funciona ""manteniendo aceitada a una pequeña maquinaria votante"". 

De nada sirve que la gente proteste si cuando tiene la oportunidad de expresarse el día de las elecciones no lo hace."
3740,"El primer paso es que le ordenen inmediatamente a la Fuerza Pública parar la hijueputez. Noche tras noche son videos de zonas residenciales gaseadas y disparos contra civiles desarmados.

3741,"Bueno... Tengo esto atravesado en el pecho desde hace rato así que supongo que mejor lo saco todo acá...

Para aclarar todo creo que ideológicamente soy anarquista y de manera pragmática soy liberal... Así que la idea seria reducir el tamaño del gobierno gradualmente hasta que desaparezca por completo.

Con respecto a lo que pienso sobre lo que esta pasando actualmente (e incluso desde hace más de 10 años) en Colombia... Creo que la ""política"" acá se asemeja más a barras bravas e hinchas que a política de verdad, la gente ve en su caudillo la solución a todos los problemas y en el caudillo contrario la fuente de todos los problemas, pero como ud dice : 

>nos resulta imposible pensar que toda propuesta o pronunciamiento no lleva un interés en sus carreras, un cálculo sobre lo que les conviene o no.

Y yo opino exactamente esto, el estado es inherentemente corrupto, este en el bando que este, el que se suba al poder dificilmente va a  buscar la reducción del poder del estado, e inevitablemente lo va a usar para promover su agenda, haciendo más grande al estado, ya sea Uribe promoviendo la guerra contra las drogas y el conservadurismo social o Petro con progresismo y su idea de redistribuir la riqueza; pero lo peor de todo es que esto no es un problema que surja de los políticos, ellos solo son empresarios que buscan complacer a su clientela. Es decir, los políticos son el reflejo de lo que la gente quiere. 


Creo que tanto la ""derecha"" como la ""izquierda"" tienen el mismo problema, lo único que quieren hacer es inflar más al estado, quieren más programas para X o para Y, que inevitablemente lleva  a mayor carga tributaria para todos y por consiguiente jode a todos menos a los políticos. 

En cuanto a la fuente del mal que actualmente nos aqueja, La reforma tributaria, está tenía contemplado lo que Petro, Gustavo Bolívar y todos los de ""izquierda"" andaban pidiendo: Una renta básica... pero claro, debido a que eso es gasto estatal solo hay dos opciones para financiarlo, o con más impuestos, o con emicion monetaria.... Pero cada bando ve lo que quiere los de ""derecha"" dirán que duque quiere ayudar a los pobre y los de ""izquierda"" ven que les quieren subir más impuestos.  La protesta y el descontento social por todo esto está totalmente justificado, y me alegra que Duque pierda apoyo, el problema es que la gente no está pensando en acabar con la raíz del problema (el estado), si no que quieren llevar el poder al ídolo que ellos adoran (esto aplica para ambos bandos). 

Los lideres del paro tienen un montón de peticiones que obviamente Implican aumentar el tamaño del estado y por con siguiente el gasto pueblico, pero claro, ellos no van a necesitar ningún impuesto ni van a tener que emitir dinero para financiarse, para ellos la plata crece en los árboles... Y quieren redistribuir la riqueza en un país que no tiene ninguna.

La solución a todo esto? No la veo cerca, seguramente moriré antes de que suceda, pero creo que habra que llevar acabo una revolución cultural donde la gente deje de creer que el estado es el la gallina de los huevos de oro que solucionará nuestros problemas, cuando la gente se de cuenta que la raíz de todos los problemas es el estado y que solo destruyendolo seremos libres y más felices podremos comenzar a ver un cambio... 


Perdon por la verborrea, tengo en mente varias acciones concretas que políticamente apoyo, pero no veo que nadie esté pensando en eso"
3742,"En esencia estoy completamente de acuerdo con usted en cuanto a que la ciudadanía tiene que participar mucho más activamente, y empezar a organizarse mucho más desde lo micro. Además, pasar de la mera protesta o de disentir, a organizarse para proponer, deliberar, crear ideas aterrizadas y basadas en información rigurosa sobre las necesidades del país. Y en que no se puede esperar que un mesías llegue para arreglar todo, cosa que obviamente no va a pasar.

Pero las reformas y leyes no son solo un papel. Esas reformas y programas definen muchas cosas; la gente tiene que ser partícipe de esos debates; con organizar actividades micro de tipo comunitario no basta, para nada. El sistema tributario, pensional o laboral y las reformas que se van a hacer sobre esos temas, nos conciernen a todos y tenemos que informarnos muy bien sobre todo eso."
3743,"Me parece curioso que casi todos los comentarios vuelven una y otra vez a alternativas políticas, ¿por qué?

Más soluciones sería mejor educación, hacerle revuelta a la cámara de justicia, aprobar pena de muerte para curruptos, violadores, etc. Así que las personas tengan más miedo y más valor a la vida.

-Contratos con el estado no pueden completar si gerentes, dueños o empleados son gente/personas encontradas culpables de sobornos o corrupcion.

3748,"Estamos los dos de acuerdo, y planteas un objetivo en lo educativo interesante. Ahora, ¿qué vas a hacer al respecto? Más allá de votar por esas propuestas cada tantos años o apoyarlas en foros en Internet, qué puedes tu, como ciudadano, hacer para avanzar en ese objetivo?"

3751,"Como dicen u/Perro_amarillo y u/criloz en sus comentarios.... Las fuerzas antimotines son comunes, si las quitan los militares o policías armados serán los que tomen su lugar... Lo que hay que hacer es cambiar a su jefe (que actualmente es el gobierno central)...  Cada gobierno local debería tener su fuerza pública ajustada a su necesidad... Con eso pasan 2 cosas

1. Es más fácil que localmente de manera democrática se reforme cada entidad policial de la región

2. Es más fácil responsabilizar al gobierno local que al nacional"
3752,"Desmontar al Esmad ¿para qué? ¿para que ahora sean fuerzas militares y policiales que no tienen ningún entrenamiento en antidisturbios, las que estén en las protestas? Eso significaría muchos más muertos y violaciones de DDHH.

O desmontar al Esmad para crear otro Esmad con otro nombre, hacer la del bobo, cambiarlo todo para no cambiar nada.

3753,"Todo país civilizado tiene su propia unidad para controlar disturbios. Solo hay que ver EEUU, Francia, Hong Kong, España, etc"
3754,"Lo que me preocupa es que con una ciudadanía incapaz de ejercer presión de forma coordinada y en el tiempo (no en un momento específico como el paro), cualquier reforma sería cosmética. En esas condiciones, si se desmonta el ESMAD seguramente se monta otra cosa"
3755,"y ya que el post es sobre alternativas,  cuál es la alternativa a el ESMAD según ud?"
3756,"Yo antes era anarquista,  ahora soy minarquista, el anarquismo  solo funciona si todos los países del mundo lo fuesen, pero eso nunca va a pasar además   se necesitan las fuerzas militares.  Colombia lo que si necesita es descentralizarse y pasarle más poder a las regiones, posiblemente dividir la figura del presidente en dos, un jefe de estado  que sería elegido de forma directa y un jefe de gobierno que sería elegido por la cámara y el senado,  así es mucho más fácil que el país se ha gobernado mediante consensos y se pase rápida las legislaciones. 

 Pero lo único que va a sacar a Colombia del atolladero es volverse indispensable en el comercio mundial, dejar de solo exportar cosas sin valor agregado, petróleo, café, flores, etc.  Y aprovechar la posición geográfica  que tenemos,  volvernos un centro de logística para Latinoamérica,  un puente entre USA y Brasil que están entre las 7 más grande economía del mundo."
3757,"El primer paso debería ser reducir el Estado, reducir el número de congresistas y representantes de cámara, tenemos que? Como doscientos setenta y punta? Es injustificable y de ahí se pierde mucho dinero y además da oportunidades a más eventos de corrupción y es más difícil de investigar y judicializar debido a la cantidad de acusaciones solo por persona. También se debería reducir el sueldo de los funcionarios públicos, específicamente del congreso, un senador no debería tener un sueldo tan alto por el sencillo hecho de que no es una posición a la cual se deba aspirar por su recompensa monetaria. 

Con solo esos primeros pasos el Estado empezará a recuperar algo de dinero y no tendremos que estar al borde de la bancarrota cada semestre."
3758,"No soy anarquista esencialmente porque creo que hay temas y problemas en lo político que no pueden ser simplemente resueltos desde lo civil, un poco como la pregunta que hace caes95 sobre la justicia; creo que aún si una sociedad lograra volverse anarquica, eventualmente surgiría una estructura que haría las veces de Estado
Sobre el problema de los políticos y su interés de aumentar su poder, por eso creo que la ciudadanía debe estar más organizada: los contrapesos no deben ser solamente entre instituciones del Estado sino entre la sociedad y ese Estado
Por último, no creo que la ""derecha"" y la ""izquierda"" quieran ambas ampliar el Estado: la derecha busca el Estado más mínimo, que permita el desarrollo económico privado, globalizado, mientras la izquierda si está más interesada en fortalecer un Estado que tenga un papel más dinámico"
3759,"Que interesante, me gustaría leer más sobre esa sociedad sin estado, cómo funcionaría, cuáles serían los pilares sobre los que se sustentará, cómo funcionaría la justicia?."
3760,"De acuerdo contigo, no era mi intención en el post decir que ""lo político, las leyes y las reformas no sirven para nada""; como le contesté a otra persona en los comentarios, no soy anarquista. Y sin duda, no podemos dejarlo tampoco quieto mientras fortalecemos la ciudadanía: hay que trabajarle a todo de forma simultánea.
Mi inquietud es que estamos tan enfocados en pensar leyes, pero no en las instituciones y el tejido social necesario para que sean efectivas: por ejemplo, la Constitución establece que el derecho a la vida es inviolable, no hay pena de muerte, hay un montón de aparatos legales e institucionales para velar por esto, pero culturalmente somos tan violentos que igual andamos en la calle con cuidado porque ""no sabemos quién es el otro""; eso no se resuelve con más policía, ni con penas más severas sino con construcción de tejido social, con un cambio cultural. Si, desde arriba, desde la política, también se puede promover esos cambios, pero me gustaría que nos pensemos qué podemos hacer desde nuestra esfera de influencia como ciudadanos, como individuos"
3761,"> ¿Definitivamente no es posible pensar acciones por fuera de lo político?

Está pidiendo demasiado."
3762,"Pero pensemos por un momento esos otros Estados en los que la corrupción no es el mismo lastre que aquí, donde los recursos se logran invertir de forma efectiva en la sociedad. ¿Qué hay de distinto? he escuchado gente hablar de que habría que ""traerse políticos del extranjero"", como si el problema fuera simplemente de los políticos. Claro, la corrupción y la mala administración corre por cuenta de los políticos, pero eso es un fenómeno social, no natural: no son corruptos simplemente por ser colombianos.
Lo que creo es que en estos otros estados la sociedad civil es más fuerte, no simplemente que la gente esté más enterada, sino que hay iniciativas civiles que ayudan a construir identidad, tejido social y veeduría a los políticos; eso nos falta acá, y eso nos toca construirlo a nosotros"
3763,"Pareces desconocer que la misma Constitución prohíbe la pena de muerte, y que ese tipo de castigos no son más que populismo punitivo, como la dichosa cadena perpetua a violadores. Sin  duda se necesita una reforma a la justicia, pero la imposición de penas más severas no sirve"
3764,"Jajaja! pues una reforma tributaria es necesaria, creo que no he escuchado al primer analista y experto que diga lo contrario; la cuestión siempre ha sido cuál. Pero volviendo a la intención de mi post, una reforma tributaria es algo que sale del orden nacional, del Estado, y mi idea es hacer una lluvia de ideas sobre lo que desde el nivel individual, desde la ciudadanía, se puede trabajar"
3765,"Yo estoy llevando internet a lugares remotos de la costa Cordobesa, donde no hay siquiera datos móviles, mi aporte es en la infraestructura que sirve de puente para que esas comunidades tengan acceso a la información y educación, lamentablemente no he pensado aún en proyectos educativos, definitivamente es algo en lo que trabajaré.

Mi inquietud constante es que esa infraestructura sea usada principalmente para ocio en redes sociales y Netflix y muy poco para temas educativos"
3766,"Ud no puede separar su vida como ciudadano de la política. A menos que decida irse ""off the grid"".

La apatía política no es como muy buena para una democracia. Que tiene de malo pedir una reforma electoral? Con una reforma electoral la idea es buscar más representación, en vez de quedarse en el sistema de la turba de las mayorías."
3767,"Es verdad por eso toca cambiar la institución encargada del ESMAD.

Hacer de Colombia una federacion, que no esten subordinados al ministerio de defensa si no al gobierno local"
3768,"Eso también es cierto. Antes del ESMAD se usaba incluso el ejercito, y llegas a cosas como la masacre en la Nacional de 1984 (curiosamente, también pasó un 16 de mayo)."
3769,"Yo creo que más que pensar alternativas al ESMAD es que este realmente funcione como debería: primero que todo, respetando sus propios protocolos, y segundo, que no se despliegue constantemente para todo y sobre todo para sabotear manifestaciones.   
Aparte de eso, no como alternativa al ESMAD sino como estrategias antes de recurrir al ESMAD, sería importante que los gobiernos locales pudieran tener una comunicación más efectiva con los organizadores de marchas y ayudarles a establecer... ""controles internos""? que les permitan a los mismos manifestantes evitar los vandalismos en las protestas"
3770,"Ninguna. Los países civilizados no utilizan escuadrones antimotines, es una salvajada latina que sólo sirve para provocar a los manifestantes.

Cuando hay disturbios que se salen de la protesta, controla la policía, para eso les pagan. Pero nadie va a la protesta directamente a provocar, eso es una total estupidez."
3771,"Podría ser con un grupo de civiles que cuiden las protestas, igual que como muchas veces se usa a los de movilidad y las cosas suelen ser mucho más pacíficas."
3772,"Creo que el anarquismo en la actualidad no es viable, pero es una meta que es la conclusión final del pensamiento liberal... No va a suceder mañana... No sucederá en nuestras vidas... Pero hay que moverse poco a poco hacia esa meta.

Actualmente el gobierno es tan grande que es como un tumor que invadió los órganos y arterias vitales, si lo quitamos súbitamente causaremos mucho daño,  y la idea es reducirlo hasta un tamaño prudente para luego eliminarlo totalmente...


>Pero lo único que va a sacar a Colombia del atolladero es volverse indispensable en el comercio mundial, dejar de solo exportar cosas sin valor agregado, petróleo, café, flores, etc. Y aprovechar la posición geográfica que tenemos, volvernos un centro de logística para Latinoamérica, un puente entre USA y Brasil que están entre las 7 más grande economía del mundo.

Totalmente de acuerdo, pero para eso el estado debe quitarse de enmedio y dejar que las personas competentes hagan el trabajo y por ahora no veo a ningún político hablando de eso"
3773,"Yo opino igual, la desigualdad se ve principalmente entre ese salario minimo y el salario de las personas que trabajan en sector publico. A esas personas le dan muchos beneficios economicos y a parte el estado tiene que pagar por todos sus gastos. Luego la pension vitalicia que tienen y a parte esto para los nuevas personas que aparecen cuatro años.

Si hay una reduccion en ese gasto pues no sabemos que pasara con esa platica porque igualmente en el estado corrupto todo ese dinero no se va reedigir a sectores que se necesiten.

En un mundo ideal que se cumpla que las ramas del poder público sean verdaderamente independientes. Que el presidente no este poniendo a cargo a sus amigos porque genera acumulacion de poder.

Luego pensando en las necesidades de las personas es necesario que la educacion publica superior sea un acceso obligatorio a los de menor recursos. No con esos programas de ser pilo y paga o icetex que genera desercion.

Decir generar mas empleo es lo mas dificil porque los privados de este pais es quien controla esa situacion.

Los subsidios a las personas se necesitan pero no un esquema para que las comunides dejen deje de producir.

Que se legaliza las drogas y el estado sea un productor. Para que quien se llene los bolsillos sea el pueblo y no los carteles de toda la vida.

En fin muchas cosas uno puede divagar pero todo tiene su complejidad, Es dificil unir a las personas cuando vive el segundo Pablo escobar  de esta epoca  (pero que va por la sombrita) y con alguien qeu se cree un Gaitan o un Galan. Nuestra sociedad se merece un Pepe mujica

Edit: Necesitamos que el sector agro crezca para los campesinos y no para los paises externos. Los TLC y otros acuerdos internacionales no permite que los campesinos ganen."
3774,"Brevemente, no creo que reducir el congreso sea necesariamente positivo: reducir el congreso favorece a los partidos políticos grandes y a las maquinarias además de que reducen la representación de las minorías en el legislativo. En cuanto a los salarios, no sé todo lo que tengan los congresistas, pero tampoco podemos pretender reducirles el salario tanto que prácticamente haya que pagar para ser congresista: ahí si que se complica la corrupción. Y tampoco eso va a ""financiar"" al país.

Pero volviendo a la intención de mi post, mi idea es que precisamente pensemos acciones que nosotros mismos podamos empezar a desarrollar desde allá, cambios a los que busquemos comprometernos después del paro: no seguir solucionando el país cuando no tenemos la capacidad de hacer esos cambios"
3775,"Bueno, yo digo ""derecha"" e ""izquierda"" porque creo que desde la perspectiva actual ambas son estatistas.... La derecha desde lo social y la Izquierda desde lo económico... aunque irónicamente cada una se comienza a parecer a la otra... La ""izquierda"" imponiendo el progresismo aparte de su intervencionismo  económico y la ""derecha"" aparte de su conservadurismo social ahora (por lo menos en Colombia) también con intervención economica y pues su nacionalismo proteccionista...

Ahora yo considero que los términos derecha e izquierda sólo logran poner a la gente una contra otra... Creo que la discusión más productiva se da desde el marco de ""los que quieren dejar a la gente en paz"" y ""los que no quieren dejar a la gente en paz""... Así nos daremos cuenta que no es los fachos contra los comunistas, sino la gente contra los políticos ladrones.

El anarquismo en el estado actual es inviable eso lo reconozco... Por eso digo que soy ideologíamente anarquista, sin embargo creo que debe ser una meta a la cual, con el tiempo, nos acerquemos cada día más. Y entender que la existencia del estado condiciona su crecimiento... Si creemos que el estado tiene legitimidad por principio y para siempre  terminaremos agrandandolo inevitablemente"
3776,"Pues como digo, ideológicamente es la idea pragmáticamente, si desmontamos el estado hoy, mañana amanecermos con uno nuevo. Antiguamente la justicia funcionaba con arbitrajes privados (así es como un partido de fútbol), los árbitros que tuvieran fama de ser justos e imparciales ganarían fama y  serían contratados de manera más frecuente.

En cuanto a cómo llegamos allá? Lo primero sería fragmentar el poder del estado, eso significaría federalizar Colombia, si cada región gana independencia es más difícil que un tirano corrompa todo el país de un solo golpe, lo siguiente sería reducir el poder del estado central eliminando ministerios o fucionandolos, esto les gustaría a los de izquierda porque la policía dejaria de ser problema del ministerio de defensa y sería problema de gobernaciones o alcaldías locales"

3801,"Resumen(45%) automatico del texto 'La estrategia oculta del Comité del Paro'.

 SEMANA conoció que este jueves, en Cali, hubo una reunión entre el Comité del Paro nacional, el Comité de Paro del Valle del Cauca y algunos integrantes de los llamados puntos de resistencia.

 Allí se acordó una detallada estrategia para alargar las protestas de manera indefinida, pese a la crisis humanitaria y de desabastecimiento en algunas regiones del país y los polémicos bloqueos.

 El primero plantea que el paro hay que ""Repotenciarlo con la acción unitaria de masas del próximo 19 de mayo"".

 En el segundo se habla de la negociación con el Gobierno nacional como una ""táctica"" y dejan claro que hay que plantear ""Las líneas rojas en torno a las garantías para la movilización y la protesta social como precondicionamientos y la participación de sectores que van más allá del CNP"". En el tercer punto del acuerdo proponen un ""Fortalecimiento"" con la incorporación de nuevos sectores sociales y populares, ""Proyectando pliegos regionales"", lo cual claramente alargaría cualquier conversación que pueda darse.

 Aunque el Comité del Paro no le ha contado al país sobre su nueva estrategia, hoy se filtró a los medios de comunicación y generó una gran alarma por el impacto que puedan seguir teniendo estas protestas y bloqueos en la vida de millones de colombianos.

3803,"Querer garantías mínimas no tiene realmente nada que ver con no querer dialogar. Antes de buscar una solución al problema de fondo, lo mas importante es buscar que no se siga asesinando a la población, o que el gobierno no pretenda seguir emboscando al comite.

No se hubiera llegado a un pacto si se le hubiera solicitado a la guerrilla que para dialogar iban a tener que entrar en una base militar colombiana. Eso es una garantía"

3806,"Aunque esas peticiones son muy bonitas, altruistas, y necesarias, me parece que no van a solucionar ningun problema:

3) A lo bien le confiarian el uso de las reservas internacionales a este gobierno? En el 2020 no se vendio buena parte del oro de Colombia, y donde estan los resultados?

3844,"De acuerdo con los otros posters. Por ejemplo en mi caso la pandemia pegó duro y unas semanas antes del paro pude volver a trabajar. Empezó el paro y nos tocó dejar de ir. Yo debo atravesar la ciudad de sur a norte y uso el mío para eso. También está que el precio de los alimentos subió exageradamente y lo que antes te alcanzaba para dos días ( hablo del dinero) ya no alcanza sino para una sola comida para 4. En Siloe hay personas que están sin insulina por ejemplo y no tienen cómo movilizarse para ir a reclamar o por lo que no hay paso no está llegando la medicina. Yo hoy fui a reclamar mi medicina y había gente que no le pudieron dar completo porque no habían podido pasar los camiones.  Aquí a todos nos está afectando esta situación , no es cuestión del encierro como dicen muchos , es cuestión de que están afectando al resto del pueblo con esos bloqueos y daños a diferentes partes. En mi sector hay ya 3 panaderías y varios restaurantes que durante pandemia pudieron sobrevivir pero que por el paro ya tuvieron que cerrar porque se quedaron sin materia prima."
3845,"Vivo en el sur de Bogotá y trabajo en el norte y la verdad aquí todos o la gran mayoría de trabajadores viven en el norte y uno los ve muy relajados, por más que intenten evitar que la gente llegue a su trabajo no lo han podido lograr y lo único que están haciendo es afectarnos a quienes nos toca atravesar la ciudad de un extremo a otro tanto para salir a nuestro lugar de trabajo como después de una larga jornada tener que llegar mamados caminando porque los desocupados están bloqueando las calles y saboteando, en ese orden de ideas digo que es una cosa inútil el joder las clases bajas y trabajadoras y que las personas que están por el norte siguen haciendo sus vidas como si nada pasara, es más aquí se habla de paro mañana pero en la oficina no les interesa nada y pues muchos van a venir porque aquí en el norte nadie viene a joder a esta gente, nos están es fastidiando a nosotros loa clase baja y nos siguen jodiendo para llegar a nuestra casa."
3846,Primero la pandemia y ahora el paro. Hay gente que necesita ir a trabajar para darle de comer a su familia para pagar la renta y más cosas de necesidad.

3849,"Entiendo completamente estás posiciones y son completamente validas al punto de que se reconoce que el bienestar de los grupos familiares particulares priman sobre ciertos factores generales. Sin embargo, hay ciertas cosas de fondo que me hacen pensar que en si esas posiciones radican en el sobrevivir y no en el  vivir de manera digna,.la gente que es empleadora debe tener un mínimo de empatía ya que al estar desde el privilegio, se les nubla bastante la perspectiva y adicionalmente se refuerza con la perspectiva y necesidad de las demás personas. Y bueno, si necesitamos para el subsitir diario, pero eso es una solución a corto plazo, pregunto yo, ¿Qué pasaría si  ya no lo necesitan a uno más? Lo más factible es que lo desechan y uno se queda sin nada. Ahí, entonces,  cambiaría la cosa, entonces, independientemente que afecte de manera sustancial muchas cosas del diario vivir, lo importante es saber que si queremos que esa desigualdad no se perpetúe más, toca obligar el cambio, tanto primero en uno, y luego en los demás. Porque si perpetuamos la desigualdad ahora con nosotros, nuestros futuros hijos, sufrirán lo mismo y se continúa el ciclo."
3850,"Si, es normal. Hay personas que necesitamos trabajar. Esos bloqueos que se estan haciendo en las ciudades solo es un ""tiro en la rodilla"" a la misma clase media-baja. Los politicos, a los que se les quiere mandar en mensaje, estan en sus fincas o fuera del pais. El bloquear una calle no va a traer a los martires caidos, y tampoco va a traer el peso de la ley a los responsables. Hacer que el metro o el transmilenio dejen de funcionar solo afecta a jovenes y clase trabajadora. Hay formas mas inteligentes de protestar y enaltecer sus memorias: como votar masivamente en el 2022, usar mecanismos democraticos como referendums, consultas, plebiscitos, entorpecer campañas electorales, y enviar las pruebas necesarias a los entes indicados para que se judicialicen los culpables. Se que hablar es muy facil...Pero esos bloqueos son muy desgastantes para el mismo pueblo."
3851,"Los que quieran protestar, pueden hacerlo frente al congreso, frente a la casa de Nariño, o frente a propiedades de reconocidos políticos. Este paro es una Hidra deforme, sin objetivos claros, mucho bochinche y pocos resultados."

Pero nadie mueve un puto dedo más allá de cuidar sus intereses y los de sus familias. Están matando gente puta madre! Estamos camino a una dictadura que saca la policía todas las noches a matar gente y ustedes pidiéndoles que no hagan ruido? Eso es como ver una persona desangrándose y pedirle que no haga regero. Descarados."
3853,"Los que están parando no son niños ricos tampoco, también son gente que necesita ir a trabajar para darle de comer a su familia, pagar la renta y más cosas de necesidad. No vagos, no holgazanes, gente como usted que además de sufrir lo mismo que usted están parados re duro en las calles. Se lo digo yo que trabajo, tengo una mamá que necesita medicinas y atención médica constantemente y protesto.
La cosa es que esto no cambia si nadie pone nada de su parte. Ahora usted no marcha, no aguanta ni balas no bolillasos, ni siquiera aguanta el esfuerzo físico que implica salir a marchar. Sabe cuál podría ser su granito de arena a qué las cosas cambien con este paro? Apoyar los bloqueos a pesar que lo afectan."

3856,"Pero es que por eso, es un paro, no hay lógica que unos paren y otros no. O todos en la cama, o todos en el suelo. Adicionalmente, a los campesinos nunca desde hace muchas décadas , cuentan con la posiblidad de sacar sus productos de manera tranquila. Entonces eso es una falacia de que los productos se pierdan, pierden los distribuidores intermedios que compran el producto menos de lo que cuesta en realidad."

3874,"Repuesta un poco irrelevante acá, pero posiblemente interesante: la navaja de Occam no es necesariamente una buena heurística. 

En vez de explicaciones sencillas, una alternativa es buscar explicaciones que son difíciles de variar (explanations that are hard to vary). Por ejemplo, parafraseando The beginning of infinity, una explicación que los griegos tenían para las estaciones era que cada año Perséfone tenía un tiempo en el cual podía salir del Hades, y que eso se expresaba en los cambios de temperatura. Esa explicación es sencilla si la comparamos con la explicación que las estaciones son debidas a la inclinación del eje de rotación de la tierra. Pero es una explicación fácil de variar: podemos cambiar Perséfone y Hades por Zeus y el Olimpo, o por la llegada del niño Dios en Diciembre. En cambio, en la explicación de la inclinación del eje de rotación, no podemos tan fácilmente cambiar el ángulo de inclinación, la velocidad de rotación de la tierra o demás parámetros: si cambiamos los parámetros, la explicación no se va a ajustar a las observaciones que hacemos sobre el clima en la tierra. Con las explicaciones difíciles de variar, lo que encontramos son explicaciones que dependen menos del contexto, y que permiten hacer predicciones más precisas.


Ahora volviendo al contexto de las protestas, posiblemente una mejor heurística a utilizar que la navaja de Occam, es la de buscar explicaciones difíciles de variar (no me pregunté cómo, yo solo estoy haciendo bien apunte irrelevante)"

Ponen el escenario para que pasen estas cosas y luego tienen la audacia de culpar a otros... Las manifestaciones y protestas SI tienen liderazgos, si no lo tienen es caos y vandalismo puro, dejen de excusarse por querer un espacio para soltar el mandril interno, están igualitos a los tombos abusivos justificando lo injustificable."
3876,"Te di un voto, aunque no estemos de acuerdo, porque estás aportando constructivamente a la discusión.

Te explico porqué no estamos de acuerdo.

Creo que has mal interpretado lo qué implica la navaja de Ockham.

> una mejor heurística a utilizar que la navaja de Occam, es la de buscar explicaciones difíciles de variar 

Estos dos principios no son contradictorios ni mucho menos mutuamente excluyentes. Es decir: una explicación simple no significa que puede estar sujeta a variaciones; tampoco significa que una explicación díficil de variar es necesariamente compleja.

El ejemplo de las estaciones y los dioses griegos, **NO** es un ejemplo de navaja de Ockham. Todo lo contrario. La explicación de cualquier fenómeno a traves de entidades ficticias NO son por ende simples. **No hay que confundir simples (falto de complejidad) con simplista (ingénuo), como es el caso de creer en dioses o explicaciones carentes de evidencia.**"
3877,"Me refería a que no tienen un líder o una cabeza impartiendo órdenes de marcha. Aunque tienen líderes no tienen una *cadena de mando*

Sí un joven decide tirar una piedra a un carro, no tiene nada de extraordinario."
3878,"Lo que quería mostrar con el ejemplo es que la navaja de Occam puede motivar a alguien a encontrar una explicación linguisticamente simple. El ejemplo de los dioses sólo se complejiza si comenzamos a agregar detalles sobre la naturaleza de los dioses en la explicación. La explicación con el ángulo de rotación tambien se puede complejizar una vez comenzamos a agregar detalles (por ejemplo, tratando de explicar porqué la tierra tiene ese eje de rotación).

La navaja de Occam nos dice que no deberíamos incluir dettalles irrelevantes, pero no dice cuando detenerse con los detalles. Decidir cuando un detalle es irrelevante queda a juicio propio (motivado por la dificultad computacional, o simplemente por estética).

Yo no quise dar a entender que la navaja de Occam y el principio de Deusthch de las explicaciones dificiles de variar fueran contradictorios o excluyentes. A lo que quería llegar es a que, con el principio de explicaciones dificiles de variar, el objetivo de la explicación es más claro y funcional: se busca una explicación que se pueda generalizar a nuevas observaciones y contextos, sin tener que ajustarla. En cambio, el objetivo de la navaja de Occam es la simplicidad en si misma."
3879,"Osea que el Comité del Paro, los lideres estudiantiles, los lideres comunitarios y los coordinadores de las marchas son teoría conspirativa o decoración... Eso que usted dice es una necedad, las marchas TODAS son organizadas, planeadas y coordinadas, no son hechas al azar ni producto de un egregor. La existencia de una cadena de mando NO IMPIDE que haya gente haciendo pendejadas sin órdenes, que el ser humano no es una hormiga ni un robot. Hasta entre fuerzas armadas pasan esas cosas, si un soldado quiere usar su arma LO VA A HACER y se enfrenta a las consecuencias haya o no recibido ordenes de hacerlo... Cuando la gente no entiende cómo funciona el poder y su relación con la Voluntad humana se cree esas excusas de cadenas de mando y organización premeditada de actos individuales.

Y antes que lo diga: La unica razón por la que un soldado que abre fuego sin orden es un crimen, y un marchante tira piedras sin una cadena de mando detrás es «normal», se debe a que a la marcha social en Colombia no la tieneb regulada Y NO LA QUIEREN REGULAR, precisamente porque tienen la loca idea que protestar es salir a quemar todo y que por arte de magia se solucione un problema (La misma lógica del abusador en una relación, cree que con golpear cosas se le va a arreglar la vida por arte de magia y la excusa «estoy emputado» lo exime de responsabilidad o carga moral) y porque, le voy a dar el dato, la marcha social en este país solo sirve para mantener los animos caldeados y que las élites puedan fidelizar sus rebaños electorales y afianzar la mentalidad de borrego en el pueblo... Un pueblo emputado NO PIENSA... Dos siglos y no notan el patrón???"
3880,"Eso no es una cadena de mando. 

Un cadena de mando es lo que tiene un ejército. Una persona da una orden y todos bajo su mando acatan.

Una protesta, un grupo de manifestantes, no tienen eso (La excepción es la minga. Pero la minga y los manifestantes no es lo mismo.)"
3881,"Entonces le reitero, usted lo que está diciendo es que tooooda esa gente que organiza el paro son unos pintados en la pared y que las protestas no tienen control... Y con ese argumento se quejan del ESMAD, que existe PRECISAMENTE para controlar turbas fuera de control? Basicamrnte acaba de decir que los marchantes son una banda de anarquistas sin ton ni son... Cuando la realidad es todo lo contrario... En el ejercito, por cierto, un general da una orden y esta se transmite a toda la cadena, los ejecutores tienen plena libertad de acción en tanto comsigan el objetivo, desde un «Capturen elemento X» hasta «Vuelen un oleoducto y luego embosquen a los que vengan a arreglarlo para capturar el objetivo» hay una diferencia propia de lo que usted dice que NO es una cadena de mando. Le repito, policías y soldados también pueden ir a hacer lo que les de la gana, no son robots ni hormigas y eso no anula la existencia de una cadena de mando. Igual que los marchantes. Todo es un tema de orden, ojo con esas concepciones, si el paro no tiene orden y es caos entonces es una amenaza para el bienestar de Colombia, basicamente justificando que los agreda la policía y la ciudadanía misma. Ojo pues, que yo se que esto no es lo que quiere decir, pero es lo que está diciendo sin darse cuenta."
3882,"Una protesta no tiene cadena de mando que cubra todos los manifestantes. 

No te lo puedo explicar más conciso que eso. Busca que significa cadena de mando si no me entiendes."

3895,"Pues mira:
primero en el comité del paro hay generalizando un poco exmiembros de guerrillas como las farc y personas que buscan instaurar un régimen comunista. (ejemplos de regímenes comunistas son Cuba y Venezuela)

Segundo el tema del robo es en parte culpa del propio colombiano que pide más subsidios que tienen que ser sacados de los impuestos de los colombianos, eso significa más impuestos es igual mayores recursos administrados por el estado lo que es igual a más corrupción. 

Tercero teniendo esto en cuenta el comité del paro no busca hacer mucho bien ya que entre todo lo que piden es más subsidios y sabemos que significa esto.

Solución posible
Podría ser eliminar la mayor cantidad de subsidios posibles para disminuir lo impuestos así dejar de poner tantos recursos en las manos del estado y con respecto al comité de paro disolver esto por que si lees sus aproximadamente 104 puntos ellos dicen que son trece pero son 104 son completamente inviables, además ellos son en parte los culpables de todo el vandalismo que llego con el paro por que por encima no pero en el fondo son igual de corruptos que nuestros políticos .

Por ultimo deberíamos no pedir comprensión y subsidios y menos impuestos, sino libertad las personas no recibirán más subsidios (que por cierto ellas mismas pagan con los impuestos ) sino que tendrán más dinero a su disposición ya que los impuestos bajan por que no habra subsidios que necesiten impuestos lo que también disminuye la corrupción por último reabrir el país porque está reforma es para pagar la deuda externa los subsidios y todo el dinero que se desperdició durante esta pandemia nunca debimos cerrar el país eso hizo más mal que bien.

2.

Efectivamente, viniendo de uno de esos países 'ricos', la gente aqui no se da cuenta lo duro que uno tiene que trabajar en esos países, lo alto que son los impuestos, lo poco se puede hacer 'en negro' (por eso también solemos ser menos simpaticos también). Aqui en Colombia los impuestos también son altos, pero muy pocos los pagan. El otro día lei que la mitad de la población ni siquiera DECLARA renta, y que solo 4% (!!!!) de la poblacion efectivamente PAGA impuesto de renta. Si muestras esta cifra a un europeo, flipa. Obviamente la solución pasará por sueldos mas altos, pero para tener sueldos más altos, la productividad también tendrá que aumentar, es decir menos puestos de trabajo pero mejor pagados, pero con más presion de trabajo y menos 'libertad/flexibilidad'.

3931,"Creo que debe girar en 3 ejes y los enumeró: 

Reducir la corrupcion, y hacer que la gobernabilidad sea más rápida.

Atender con ayudas sociales a las partes de la sociedad que lo necesitan ,pero el subsidio debe permitirles trabajar de hecho deberían para que el que lo reciba, debe tener actos que está luchando para salir de esa zona de riesgo.

Y el tercer punto reducir las excepciones tributarias que tienen muchas áreas industriales.

Pero se que estos temas con los gobernantes que existen (derecha, izquierda, centro) no van a ponerse de acuerdo, les pregunto es muy descabellada la idea de una Constituyente y así se reforman todos esos puntos directamente...

3943,"Con respecto a la declaracion de renta, quizas el mayor 'pero' es que se requiere pagar un contador, lo cual puede ser un costo considerable para una persona cuyo salario es de $2.500.000 mensuales. Pondre el ejemplo de Noruega otra vez, la declaracion de renta se hace a traves de un aplicativo web super facil de llenar, y no se requiere de intermediarios para nada. 

De hecho, en un sistema ideal, todos deberiamos declarar renta, con el fin de que el Gobierno tenga datos suficientes para saber quien debe pagar impuestos y quien debe recibir subsidios. Pero es esa corrupcion la que no nos deja progresar."
3944,"Es verdad. 

En Colombia la gente no quiere pagar impuestos, así deba hacerlo y tenga con qué. Yo trabajé haciendo ese recaudo y tuve que escuchar cada cosa, varias veces me quisieron ""untar la mano"" para desaparecer la cuentica... pedimos unos políticos y un gobierno menos corrupto y en nuestro día a día hacemos esto."

No entendi tu punto sobre los sindicatos. Un sindicato Noruego participa activamente de la politica, de hecho, tienen partidos politicos, y se reunen periodicamente con el Gobierno. Aqui los sindicatos solo se limitan a hacer marchas, pero no hay cambios de fondo. Cuantos referendums, plebiscitos han convocado los sindicatos en Colombia?

4006,Yo pensé que estábamos en guerra civil ya. Hace 70 años me parece.
4007,"> Fueron siete las peticiones que se incluyeron en el pliego del Comité del Paro. LR calculó que llevar a cabo tres de ellas tendría un costo fiscal aproximado de $81,5 billones, una cifra que es más de cinco veces el recaudo que buscaría el Ministerio de Hacienda con el nuevo articulado de la reforma tributaria ($14 billones).

Pareciera que no es viable la cosa :("
4008,"Eso es descabellado desde un inicio, pero igual creo que piden eso porque es una negociación y de ahí ceden de parte y parte, igual no creo que vayan a pedir lo básico y ceder terreno en eso , pero puede ser un arma de doble filo, porque van a decir vea lo que piden y todo ese tipo de cosas"

4014,Jaja ese golpe no lo vimos venir.

4017,"Total ! Pero como yo lo veo es que el problema de la corrupción y el  del referendo es el mismo. Los colombianos no estamos votamos a conciencia cuando toca. 

Comprar votos es barato porque hay pocos personas que están votando y se puede ganar fácil comprándolos. Qué pasaría si todos votáramos? Que sería inviable comprar tanto voto y comprometer tantos puestos gubernamentales. A los políticos les tocaría convencer a la gente a punta de buenas propuestas. 

Colombia tiene una gran oportunidad cada 4 años de cambiar las cosas y debemos reconocer que el poder no está en la violencia sino en una pinche papeleta."
4018,"nah, man ni me hagas acordar, ese día entendí que el problema de Colombia va más allá de los políticos."
4019,"Eso no soluciona nada, en Sudamerica solo Chile y Colombia el voto no es obligatorio, los demás países tienen hasta sanciones económicas por no votar y no es que les vaya mejor en temas de corrupción."
4020,"No estoy hablando de poner una multa por no votar. Se ha demostrado que en los países que es obligatorio votar hay personas después de 20 días ya ni se acuerdan del candidato por el que votaron.

Lo que digo es que se debe hacer un voto a conciencia en los momentos adecuados. Hablando desde el contexto del referendo y debido a que seguimos eligiendo a los mismos corruptos de siempre."

No me consta pero es razonable asumir que la mensajería por compañías de paquetes debe estar retrazada."
4027,"Por lo que entiendo un proceso de revocatoria ahorita no asegura que los próximos presidentes, congresistas y senadores sean nuevamente corruptos. Lo único que se me ocurre que puede ayudar es que cada persona de un voto responsable y consiente por un candidato que en verdad los represente en cada una de las próximas votaciones. Así comprar votos se vuelve algo sumamente difícil de hacer porque les saldría muy caro y además los políticos asumirían el puesto comprometidos con propuestas a la gente que le dio el voto (más no gracias a mermelada ya que no alcanzaría a ser viable si todos votáramos)."

Uno ha ostentado el poder por lo menos por 8 años, y el otro apenas viene agarrando tracción como una figura antagónica (irónicamente, producto de los mismos partidarios de Uribe. De otro modo, se hubiese quedado con el mismo perfil con el que tienen a Cepeda).

Más allá de la cuestionable alcaldía que tuvo, su pasado en el M-19 y su video de las bolsas, la influencia de Petro aún palidece frente a la de Uribe. Sin mencionar que la dimensión de sus escándalos políticos es completamente desigual.

Considero que igualarlos es trivializar una coyuntura política mucho más compleja y que tiene diferentes aristas, y no solo dos polos y un centro (prácticamente la narración maniqueista que sustenta al uribismo en vacas flacas)."
4049,"por qué? ósea no es como si uno tuviera una gigantesca responsabilidad en la situación actual del pais, la corrupción, falsos positivos, que el pais este en manos de los grandes empresarios fanáticos del monopolio, el bipartidismo y la satanización de la izquierda política o cualquiera que piense diferente a el

mientras que el otro es un progresista, que no es corrupto, que no miente y que la única razón de por que les cae mal es por que el uribismo supo como manchar su reputación, porque no, Petro y Uribe son completamente diferentes, no solo en política"

4053,"Frente a la responsabiliad histórica, sin duda estoy con usted. Hay algunas cosas que quedaron pendientes (o cuanto menos sin mencionar) de la administración de Petro en Bogotá (las cuales, sin duda alguna, no se comparan con lo que realizó Uribe). 

Frente a la forma de realizar polítca, y a su forma de administrar, difiero profundamente con usted."
4054,"Petro no sataniza al que piensa diferente a él? wuau primera vez que lo escucho. Según él mismo, se atribuye la creación de algo asi como dos mil quinientos nuevos empleos en Bogotá, claro lo que no dice es incrementó la burocracia y las corbatas, así hasta yo genero 2.500 empleos nuevos (no sostenibles).

 En cuánto al progresismo, el mas famoso de Latinoamérica ha sido Chávez dicho también por el mismo comandante en una de tantas entrevistas en 1998 semanas antes de su elección y luego ratificado por Petro en 2002 (también disponible en YouTube por si acaso) entonces pues ser progresista no es sinónimo de maravilla o que sea el ""cambio"".     

 Colombia no necesita mas Mesías y tristemente el señor Petro se ve así mismo como tal (fuentes disponibles, si las necesitas las busco y te las paso) y decir algo ligeramente negativo de él o mostrarse en desacuerdo con él es ganarse la enemistad de sus huestes. (véase como se expresa Levy Rincón de Daniel Coronel por no ser petrista y no desgastarse en ese debate).

 Adicionalmente Petro no le tiembla la lengua para mentir con relación a sus cifras, véase en su Twitter cuando el mismo se echa flores diciendo que bajo la pobreza dimensional de Bogotá durante su gestión, claro omitió decir que fruto de las regalías de la nación en la década dorada de las materias primas todo el país la bajó? Que es real en lo que el dice? Entonces, cuando la gente dice que Uribe y Petro son lo mismo es porque sienten que son mas  los rasgos que los acercan que los que los alejan, cuál entonces es el motivo para desconocer el sentir de muchos? O más bien por que lo creen o no le creen? O te parece que cuándo el se llena la boca diciendo, YO saqué 8 millones de votos será que el man no dice, coño votaron por mí porque no querían votar por Porky? No, no lo piensa... el man está convencido que el los sacó porque viene de una costilla de Jesus,  bueno eso último no tengo respaldo me dejé llevar.
 Finalmente por que HDP tenemos que votar por X para que no quede Y? Por que HDP nos perdemos de gente buena por eso? Porque  la  gente tiene que votar con miedo o con rabia? O tu crees que el innombrable llegó por qué? Porque la gente tenía rabia estaba podrida de la guerrilla. Las condiciones son similares solo que para el otro lado con un personaje con los mismos rasgos del otro pero de izquierda. Entonces? Para dónde vamos?"
4055,"el peor error que podemos hacer es creer que porque son disidentes son mejores, este gobierno es una mierda y si gobierna la izquierda lo va a hacer igual, este gobierno te mete una reforma tributaria en medio de pandemia como unos hijos de puta y un gobierno de izquierdas tambien te va a subir los impuestos pero con palabras mas bonitas como por ejemplo ""justicia social"" ""renta basica universal"" o ""estado de bienestar"" igual te quieren clavar e igual te quieren robar, misma mierda solo que uno llegó al poder y el otro no"

Mire, creo que me exprese mal en varios sentidos, a ver, me dije que no mentía refiriéndome a como lo hace uribe y en general los uribistas, no que inflaba números y se atribuía cosas que el no hizo o que no necesariamente fueron por el, me salte la parte de la comparación jaja
Ahora, hablar de Chávez como progresista... Hasta donde yo se era más socialista pero bueno , en cualquier caso, el man fue un dictador que no supo manejar a Venezuela y jodio en todo lo que se podía joder y hasta más, pero no mms, chavez y Petro son polos opuestos dentro de la izquierda por favor
Por último, quiero agregar que si bien apoyo a Petro sobre los candidatos actuales, obviamente estoy en contra de muchas de sus ideas, pero con los hptas uribistas corruptos y asesinos y con los de centro hipócritas y muchos corruptos, pues Petro es la mejor opcion"

4124,"Kali Uchis es una cantante de R&B colombiana, pero ya conquistó el mainstream de Estados Unidos, esto porque surgió de allá.

4125,"Personalmente no he estado presencialmente en las marchas o en los puntos de resistencia, pero se que muchas veces la gente empieza a cantar arengas y todo (ejem ""!a parar para avanzar¡ !viva el paro nacional¡).  
De canciones ya muy especificas no sabría decirte, pero en lo personal siento que las canciones de residente y las de victor Jara son bastante relacionadas a la protesta y a la crítica social"

4134,"Se lo voy a decir de la manera mas cruda posible:

1.- No hay un objetivo definido en esas protestas. Sacar a duque?, nuevas elecciones?, eliminar el congreso?.

2.- Al no haber objetivo y afectar directamente el aparato productivo (que nada tiene que ver con el sector político) la gente comienza a cansarse.

3.- Los vandalos que son menos del 5% de los protestantes (puede haber hasta infiltrados), terminan por desacreditar las protestas.

4.- Los politicos de izquierda que buscan pescar en rio revuelto y que no les interesa el pueblo colombiano, pero reciben financiamiento de paises que odian a Duque (por ejemplo Venezuela), continuan en redes sociales aupando la protesta (nuevamente sin un objetivo definido), solo para mostrar poder ante los conservadores y negociar por debajo de la mesa con ellos (sigue estando fuera el pueblo de todo esto).

Por todo esto no veo las protestas por buen camino, pienso mejor que de este proceso debe nacer un lider diferente que aglutine a todos los afectados y que logre hacer un peso suficiente para que a través del voto puedan cambiar el destino del pais."
4135,"Quizás el diálogo y la vida estén garantizados en una democracia saludable y plena... pero la nuestra está enferma y es débil. Es suficientemente ver el mal direccionamiento de la policía la cual de forma con doctrina militar y no como un cuerpo cívico garante de derechos humanos humanos, a esto súmele que es un organismo muy susceptible a la corrupción y no tienen evaluaciones psicológicas rígidas ni formación apropiada en DIH.

Usted puede inferir la poca disposición al diálogo de un gobierno cuando comienza con el discurso del enemigo interno y actúa de forma ineficiente para que la propia llama de la protesta se ahogue por extenderse tanto tiempo"
4136,"> ¿No están la vida y el diálogo garantizados en una democracia?

De hecho, hubo un diálogo entre los líderes de la protesta y el gobierno. Pero no es suficiente que la gente no sea feliz hasta que haya un cambio de gobierno.

Colombia es un país violento en 2020 hubo 12018 asesinatos. Lo que significa que en promedio 33 personas son asesinadas todos los días. El 40% de la población vive en la pobreza y solo el 25% más rico del país es lo que podemos considerar de clase media. La mayoría son pobres

La violencia no se detiene solo porque el gobierno cambia de posición. Continúa hasta que se resuelven los problemas ecenomico de la sociedad."

4141,"Eso de que no hay objetivos no es cierto, y muestra lo mucho que se ha informado solo por medios tradicionales. Los jóvenes si se han organizado en sus pueblos y localidades sacando peticiones muy concretas, por ejemplo la reforma a la policía, que una reforma tributaria se contruya en diálogo con otros sectores, una renta basica... Entre muchas más. La cosa es que Duque se siente dialogar con ellos y deje de dispararles.

 No comprenden que una caída del PIB les afecta negativamente.  Las navieras han estado desviando las exportaciones a los puertos de Cartagena y Barranquilla o en Ecuador.  Para eso se beneficiarán las economías de la costa caribeña, Ecuador y Panamá y la economía de Buenaventura declinará.

Si no le gusta que los pobres tomen sus contenedores como rehenes.  Entonces espero que en las próximas elecciones voten por alguien que aumente sus impuestos para mantener a los pobres, para que puedan comer, para que puedan obtener una educación y comprender cómo funcionan realmente los mercados.  Entonces no tomarán sus contenedores como rehenes y entenderán que al hacerlo se están haciendo más daño a sí mismos que a usted.

> 3) si son infiltrados por qué va eso a desacreditar la protesta? y si no lo son, lo invito a revisar la historia... a ver cuantos cambios a favor de las clases más bajas han sido completamente no violentos


Desacreditan la protesta de la manera en que se cambia el foco de discusión al accionar de esos reducidos grupos, apoyándose más la idea en sectores contrarios de usar la fuerza porque ""vandalizaran y robaran nuestros negocios"" o similares. Dejando que esos mismos grupos y el gobierno ""legitimen"" sus crímenes mientras que las protestas pacíficas y sus líneas de defensa e información (Primera Línea, ONG's, periodistas, médicos etc) son los que pagan el pato.

Además de que esas no-pacificas revoluciones o revueltas a las que te refieres son más parecidas a lo que ha hecho las FARC, el ELN, el M-19 etc en este país (no los aplaudo ni los apoyo) que un grupo de gente quemando un banco o un autobus mientras que la primera línea está siendo pisoteada. Debido a que esas revoluciones han sido hijueputas guerras civiles jodidamente sangrientas y bien armadas. No un grupo de gente que quema un edificio o medio asaltan una tienda (se roban solo los televisores, sera que se los irán a comer o vender) y se escudan entre la población civil. Que si los críticas, te dicen que están tirando la tiranía rompiendo uno que otro vidrio o que ""nada se ha hecho con protestas pacíficas"",  pero si les propones que la población civil tenga armas para su defensa o cosas así, es que se necesita un país en paz o ""nada se resuelve con violencia""."

4182,"Primero, la renta básica es darle un ingreso a los más necesitados, lo que implica un aumento en la demanda de productos, lo cuál genera un aumento en el precio de la oferta para mantener el equilibrio, eso es igual a la inflación, el porcentaje promedio de aumento del costo de vida de las personas.

Ahora, según lo demostrado en las pruebas controladas en Finlandia, la renta básica no ayuda al aumento del empleo, lo que en una aplicación en masa bajaría la producción y por ende la oferta, eso genera mayor aumento de precios y dispara la inflación, mayor inflación implica una economía poco competitiva"

4189,"Otro dato clave que perturba a la Corte Interamericana: algunas de las 276 personas que a día de hoy siguen reportadas como desaparecidas en el marco del Paro Nacional **aparecieron** **muertas**.

Traducción (a ver si queda más claro): efectivamente el Estado está capturando, torturando y matando y despareciendo forzosamente.

La ONG Temblores dice que estas desapariciones se adjudican al Estado porque las personas reportan a sus familiares que la policía se los están llevando a un sitio X y cuando los familiares van a preguntar al sitio X no les dan razón de dónde están sus desaparecidos, de manera que así se determina (se filtra por así decirlo) que no son desapariciones independientes del Paro. No hay que esperar ningún tiempo para reportar desaparecidos (a veces dicen que toca esperar 72 horas pero eso es falso), se reporta a alguien como desaparecido en el momento que no se tiene conocimiento de su paradero a pesar de que la policía les dice que están en un lugar en el que realmente no están."

¿De qué está hablando? Con esa frase estaba haciendo referencia a las peticiones del Comité del paro, ninguna de las cuales tiene que ver con reabrir la frontera.

La segunda frase que cita hace parte de otro párrafo y de otra discusión, y además también la sacó de contexto y no hace referencia al cierre de la frontera, sino al hecho de que usted dijo que había que desarrollar el comercio con Venezuela y hacer regresar a los venezolanos a su país (con lo cual se contradice con respecto a lo de reabrir la frontera). Yo sí creo que la frontera debe estar abierta, Duque la cerró por la pandemia, Maduro la ha hecho cerrar varias veces. Pero dinamizar el comercio con Venezuela depende de que exista una economía en Venezuela, y esta cada vez se contrae más y más.

En ese mismo hilo hizo lo mismo, sacando de contexto y tergiversando varias cosas que dije. Le respondí de vuelta, lo refuté, y no respondió más. Aquí está la discusión: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Colombia/comments/n9lvzj/seguimos\_en\_pie\_de\_lucha/gxt501a/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Colombia/comments/n9lvzj/seguimos_en_pie_de_lucha/gxt501a/?context=3)

&#x200B;

>Ahora resulta ser que el gobierno anunció que va a abrir las fronteras con Venezuela aplicando normas de bioseguridad. O sea, mágicamente después del paro desaparecieron todos los riesgos por COVID que mantuvieron dichas fronteras cerradas por más de un año

O de pronto ahora el Gobierno tiene una capacidad de hacer testeos mucho mayor que la que tenía hace un año, por ejemplo? Además de haber negociado y asegurado más de 70 millones de vacunas.  
  


>La realidad es que el gobierno empieza a mostrar su desespero porque sabe que tiene que reactivar la economía a como dé lugar y especialmente en Cúcuta,

O de pronto ese es el trabajo del gobierno? Intentar dinamizar y reactivar la economía, y buscar un equilibrio entre actividad económica y salud.

>la situación del gobierno es particularmente débil porque se quedó sin las cartas de acusar al gobierno venezolano de reprimir la protesta pacífica.

¿? Lo siento, Chávez, pero no. Los abusos de DDHH en Venezuela no dejan de existir en razón de lo que suceda en Colombia. Igual Colombia está en la OEA y en otros organismos, y eso la obliga a tomar parte en las denuncias y medidas contra esos abusos, de la misma forma que tiene que responder por los abusos aquí.

Lo que cita de Maduro no demuestra que tenga ninguna sartén por el mango, demuestra que Venezuela también cerró su frontera, contrario a lo que usted decía.

Mirando en su historial de posts también miré por encima y descubrí otras estupideces que dijo en otras discusiones, como que ""la reforma tributaria se aprueba al todo o nada"" (completamente falso)."
4192,"Esté abierta o cerrada la frontera con Venezuela, es lo mismo. Aunque cerrada es más peligroso en general, te lo dice alguien que ha vivido toda su vida ahí."
4193,"Se le olvida que ahorita en la frontera está una de nose cuantas disidencias de las FARC dándose palo con el ejército venezolano al tal punto que casi toda la gente de un pueblo venezolano se tuvo que venir aca, no lose Rick, eso no da ganas de abrir la frontera"
4194,"Hola. No entiendo por qué la molestia, si incluso tuve la gentileza de hacer una mención a u usuario para que estuvieras al tanto de lo que publiqué. 

En realidad no tengo ganas de discutir contigo. Creo que tenemos distintas interpretaciones de la discusión y, sin ánimo de ofender, no creo que estés discutiendo de buena fe. Yo literalmente inicié mi argumento con la siguiente frase:

>... debería Duque, por ejemplo, dejar de pendejear con lo de Maduro y los derechos humanos y abrir la frontera para que se dinamice el comercio con Venezuela... Nada más por ahí tienes cientos de millones de dólares para empezar a cerrar la brecha fiscal. 

Luego mencioné un conjunto de acciones que **yo** considero pudieran ayudar a recaudar fondos distintas a las que aparecían en la reforma tributaria original incluyendo - y esta es una idea enteramente propia, basada en evidencia y que mal pudiera yo endilgársela al Comité del Paro - de legalizar el cannabis e imponer fuertes tributos a su consumo y comercialización. 

Culminé la lista señalando que:

>El Estado tiene herramientas a su disposición para hacer frente a la crisis. 

**Unas herramientas que claramente partieron de mí - /u/Beginning_Beginning - no del Comité del Paro**. ¿Qué carajos iba a saber yo (o cualquiera de nosotros si a ver vamos) cuáles eran esas propuestas en ese momento? Y sin embargo tú empezaste a responder cada uno de **mis** puntos: ""impuesto a las bebidas azucaradas, puede ser, puede que no...""; ""medidas y proyectos en curso para reducir los gastos de funcionamiento del Estado ya hay varias...""; ""lo de impulsar el comercio con Venezuela no tiene sentido..."", y culminaste escribiendo que ""en general no hay razón para que el Gobierno 'conceda' así como así ninguno de esos puntos. Son cosas que requerirían muchísimo más debate y deliberación"".

Seamos serios por favor. ¿Ahora resulta ser tú estabas era respondiendo los puntos del Comité del Paro? ¿De dónde salió eso y cómo alguien podría saberlo?

Tú expusiste las razones por las cuáles lo de impulsar el comercio con Venezuela no tenía sentido, yo expliqué por qué tu razonamiento era errado y tú contra-argumentaste señalando razones adicionales. Es todo parte del mismo hilo de discusión. Estoy al tanto de la frase ""Obvio que yo creo que debe estar abierta"" pero ello no concuerda con la idea de que ""impulsar el comercio con Venezuela no tiene sentido"" cuando yo enlacé no una sino cuatro fuentes de empresarios colombianos solicitando apoyo al ejecutivo a lo largo de un año para que se abriera la frontera y así impulsar el comercio con Venezuela. Ya ahí no había más que responder, tú hiciste un comentario basado en suposiciones personales que no se sostienen a la luz de los hechos (y a la final tuve yo la razón, Duque abrió la frontera). 

Con respecto a lo demás no voy a comentar. Guarda esta conversación y revísala periódicamente cuando veas lo que va a pasar con Guaidó, con las elecciones de alcaldes y gobernadores en Venezuela, con la bajada de tono de las acusaciones de Colombia hacia Venezuela y el cambio de actitud del grupo de Chile, con la mejora del comercio binacional luego de que el gobierno colombiano se vea obligado a negociar de tú a tú con Maduro y se le olvide el gobierno interino y toda el cuento de los derechos humanos (que Colombia también se pasa por el forro).

A la final a los hechos no les importan los comentarios formulados en Reddit por un par de desconocidos."
4195,"Lo ideal dicta que un gobierno debería tomar las mejores decisiones para garantizar el bienestar de los pobladores. 

Una visión más pragmática (más cínica, aunque más ajustada a nuestras realidades) es que un gobierno debería tomar las mejores decisiones que le permitan mantenerse en el poder, lo cual uno esperaría que implique garantizar el bienestar de los pobladores para que estos los vuelvan a votar en las siguientes elecciones.  

La gente que ha leído este post y le ha hecho downvotes quizás no se ha dado cuenta de que, la ineptitud de Duque es porque no ha sabido tomar decisiones adecuadas, por ejemplo en materia de COVID (el bienestar de las personas), pero aún si no le importase el bienestar de las personas, más importante aún es que no ha tomado las decisiones adecuadas que debería haber tomado si quiere mantenerse en el poder. 

Puede que estando la frontera abierta o cerrada con Venezuela sea lo mismo, pero la percepción de la gente vale muchísimo y hay cosas que son indudables: uno, que Cúcuta está vuelta mierda y el cierre de frontera le dio durísmo; dos, que la gente de Cúcuta lleva un año rogándole a Duque porque abra la frontera; tres, que el Norte de Santander es crucial en el plan electoral del Centro Democrático para las elecciones del 2022; cuatro, que el gobierno así lo reconoce y - a pesar de haber dicho lo contrario hace apenas un mes cuando Duque ""definitivamente descartó esta posibilidad"" - le tocó volver a abrir la frontera; cinco, que lo hace desde una posición débil, con una imagen internacional seriamente opacada, pero negándose a negociar con Venezuela y apoyando a un gobierno paralelo venezolano que la Unión Europea dejó de reconocer en enero. 

De paso, está contra el tiempo en bajar las tensiones y reactivar la economía porque aún no ha acabado el paro y mientras tanto está tratando de mejorar la imagen del país y sacar una nueva reforma tributaria que tiene que pasar sí o sí y pronto, porque si no Fitch y Moody's también van a calificar la deuda colombiana como BBB- lo cual sería fatal. Para rematar, estamos en medio de un tercer pico de pandemia que está matando a 500 colombianos todos los días y que de repente obliga otra vez a cerrar los pasos por concepto de cuarentena (con todo y que ya ni nos acordemos). 

Esa es la realidad, yo no entiendo qué es tan difícil de aceptar. Como le dije al otro usuario: guarde este post y veremos cuál va a ser la actitud del gobierno de Duque frente al de Maduro en los meses por venir, vamos a ver cómo evoluciona el conflicto venezolano este año electoral, vamos a ver cómo Guaidó sale como corcho de limonada."

Los downvotes a menudo ocurren porque a la mayoría de cuentas en este sub no les gusta leer posts de las fronteras, Cúcuta, Catatumbo o Norte de Santander cuando el autor es diferente a un extranjero. Suma que recordás las malas decisiones del gobierno y luego citas otro redditor con el que tuviste argumentos y obvio votarán con todas sus multis.

Conociendo casi todos los departamentos de la frontera con Memezuela, son relevantes sus comentarios, pero recuerde que el peor enemigo de un colombiano es otro con preconceptos que desconoce ""pasar la hoja"" para superar un tema ;)"
4198,"Muchas gracias por los consejos, eres un grande <3"
4199,Excelentes concejos!!!
4200,"Totalmente de acuerdo, yo hice el icfes en marzo y me saqué 374, no planeo repetirlo, pero todos tus consejos son prácticamente lo que hice y me ayudó muchísimo, les recomiendo el pre icfes que yo tomé, es el de politécnico los alpes, buenos profesores y con los videos de su canal y de los otros canales de pre icfes en YouTube quedé muy preparada.

También les recomiendo la serie cronografia de canal 13, está toda en YouTube y me sirvió mucho para aprender historia de Colombia y de otros países, suerte a todos en septiembre! (o creo que es en agosto)"
4201,"Cuando hice el icfes en 2019 me parecio solo una prueba de que tan bien sabia leer y hacer cuentas en la cabeza. Tomé un pre icfes por obligacion del colegio pero me parecio un chiste. No fui un estudiante ejemplar pero con tan solo lo que aprendí en el colegio mi puntuacion estuvo en el percentil <1% de todos los que lo tomaron, lo cual me hizo flipar porque saque 375 lol y estoy seguro que lo pude haber hecho mucho mejor con mas preparacion y menos ego  de mi parte. 

En resumen, la dificultad del icfes es sobreestimada y cualquier persona con habitos de estudio adecuados puede sacar >350 IMO. El examen de la nacional es un reto mucho mas interesante."
4202,"Muy de acuerdo con todo pero, ¿la constitucion?, puede ser que tenga una memoria basura (que lo mas seguro sea el caso) pero ¿hay preguntas de la constitución y a mi ya se me olvido?"
4203,"Excelentes consejos. Yo hice el mío hace 21 años, antes de que lo actualizaran al de ahora… yo hice algo muy similar a lo que tú propones aquí. Les agrego algo que nos dijo el profesor de cálculo a nosotros: 2 días antes dejen de estudiar. Lo que no aprendieron en meses en 2 días no lo logran y lo que hacen es sobre cargarse. También lleven agua y maní por si les da fatiga. No se si aún vendan ese libro pero por lo menos yo estudié con uno que se llamaba cómo ingresar a la universidad , tenía todos los temas que vez en el Icfes con preguntas muy similares ( bueno en esa época) era un libro hecho por profesores de la universidad Del Valle ( mi profesor de cálculo y su hermano creo) a mi me ayudo mucho porque no pude pagar un pre icfes y mi puntaje en esa época fue bastante alto. 
Mucha suerte a todos los que van a presentar el icfes ‘"

4206,"Yo tuve un buen puntaje en el Icfes, pero sé que hubiera podido alcanzar al mejor de mi colegio si hubiera leído mejor la constitución. Me acuerdo que hubo como 6 preguntas relacionadas con esto que quedé con dudas a la hora de responder"

pasar la ambulancia"
4211,"Lamentable y repudiable hecho. Pero no entiendo, porque se busca culpables entre policías y manifestantes? Los políticos que han gobernado este país son los verdaderos culpables. Estos se descaran cuando salen a decir a pedir que la violencia pare, cuando ellos mismos han creado las condiciones para ella con su negligencia, corrupción e ineptitud. No nos dejemos confundir por favor. Los culpables de estos hechos de muerte y violencia es la clase política."
4212,"La parte de la protesta que tu ignoras es que hay al menos 41 muertos por las balas de la policía, al menos 200 desapariciones sin esclarecer, y te concentras en un suceso doloroso que no promovieron los manifestantes."
4213,"Como es ""la parte de la protesta que este sub no quiere ver""?, claramente escuchando el testimonio uno determina que fue la autoridad la que no dejo pasar, ellos son los unicos lanzando explosivos y lacrimogenos, en pocas palabras lo que se ha esta montando en el sub."
4214,La gente se empeña en creer que los manifestantes son seres impolutos. Realmente no creen que esto pasa.
4215,"Ni siquiera fueron los protestantes gran huevón, la bebé murió por haber respirado gases lacrimógenos y la propia policía fué la que disparó a la Ambulancia con las granadas de gas y de aturdimiento."
4216,Por que no hay un buen hospital en buenaventura?
4217,"Tienes toda la razón. La triste realidad es que ya no se le puede creer a nadie. Ningún lado está libre de pecado, cada uno cuenta su mentira y nosotros decidimos que mentira nos gusta mas. Al final del día, no ha cambiado nada. El paro tuvo resultados? Creo que como muchos fue un esfuerzo en vano que trajo más discordia que otra cosa. Los policías también son personas, y no de dinero. Pobres contra pobres, se matan entre sí y nada gana."
4218,"¿Ambos lados? Hay claramente un lado que controla la mayoría de la narrativa. Mencionan a cada rato las víctimas de abuso policial (que no defiendo, obviamente), pero apuñalan a un comandante de la Policía o abusan sexualmente a una uniformada y nadie dice ni mu."
4219,esto es lo que sucede cuando una población carece de acceso a la educación. Empiezan a carecer de la habilidad del pensamiento crítico porque nunca les enseñaron cómo cuestionar todo y pensar objetivamente.
4220,"conforme íbamos pasando empezaron a tirarnos cosas explosivas y gases lacrimógenos"", los manifestantes pues sí podrían tirar explosivos, es cierto, pero no tienen lacrimógenos, si hay lacrimógeno mientras pasa una ambulancia, hay un único culpable"
4221,Los problemas que tiene el país vienen de mucho antes que el centro democrático existiera amigo. Se nota que eres muy joven para decir eso
4222,"¿""siempre""?, no, ya hay varios casos de manifestantes que no dejan pasar ambulancias. Hay un video de un bloqueo en donde no dejan pasar una ambulancia, uno de los idiotas bloqueando la vía les dice que ""busquen otra ruta""... voy a buscarlo."
4223,Eso no es del todo cierto. Habia un video que subieron aqui donde ellos bloquearon un señor con ataque cardiaco y se ve que son los que bloquean. Hay protestantes muy malos tambien que no estan dejando pasar.

4225,">al menos 41 muertos por las balas de la policía

falso, de esos 41 muertos no todos fueron por balas de la policía. de hecho, dos son policías. Otros fueron asesinato de civiles contra civiles, también hubo una muerte por paro cardiaco, otra por accidente."
4226,"No son los únicos lanzando explosivos...que pena pero eso es de parte y parte. He estado en varias y he visto tanto abuso policial como victimización por parte de los manifestantes...todos los que no son de aquí deberían ver la historia completa. Deberían ver como se meten a robar a los súper mercados, como atacan a gente que no tiene nada que ver y como cobran para poder pasar por las vías...eso también es parte de la protesta y los únicos bastardos animales no son los de la policía..."
4227,"Los insultos nunca llevan a un diálogo constructivo amigo. Te recomiendo bajes los humos, vivirás mas feliz"
4228,"Ojala existiera algun medio que contara las cosas como son pero todos son biased con las cosas. Sigo a varios politicos de derecha-izquierda en twitter y es horrible como manipulan a los jovencitos con mentiras.   Estudie en una Universidad Privada-Publica y vi lo peor de ambos bandos con los profesores. El Conservador Catolico Megauribista y el Commie que Glamorizaba Cuba-El Marxismo.

Yo personalmente creo que el paro fue justo y funciono pero es inhumano no preocuparse victimas de ambos lados y por todas las familias que se fueron a la calle-perdieron todo por esto......tambien si trae crisis economica al pais peor que las reformas entonces cual es el punto???? remedio peor que la enfermedad? aqui ambos lados se estan haciendo los sordos y pueden arruinarnos a todos si siguen con esto. Que busquen soluciones rapido y ya. Duque en que piensa porque tan lento????? A este paso lo que ocurrira es una Guerra Civil o algo porque las personas ya estan cansadas.

Aqui existe una mezcla de cosas. Causas muy justas porque el gobierno tiene muy descuidado todo-Interes politicos de ambos extremos-Covid....un desastre total. No me gusta Santos nada pero al menos en su mandato hubo mas tranquilidad. Bring me back to 2016 hahaha when life was good ⭐

Un abrazo parcero. Esperemos pronto termine todo esto y Colombia pueda aprender-mejorar con esto. Praying for the future of this country."

4231,"Bueno eso si es cierto en este sub. Falta mucha objetividad aqui y si lo mencionas te tachan de ""tibio"" los violentos. A mi me parece eso terrible. Cuando se habla de los muertos pero se ignora que tambien muchos policias murieron como el que le pegaron las puñaladas que se ve no era mala persona. Yo soy de izquierda pero algunas persona de mi bando a veces me dan miedo."
4232,Totalmente de acuerdo. Todo esto se da por la falta de educacion tan severa que tenemos en Colombia.
4233,"Además de la falta de educación, tampoco sabemos cómo se maneja el país, desconocemos las leyes y la estructura del Estado, así hayamos pasado por la universidad. De esto se valen los políticos y los medios para manipularnos a su antojo."
4234,"Hmmm....cuerto, la policia esta haciendo bastantes cosas incorrectas, yo tambien vi el video donde salen con tv nuevecito, y otras cosas, tambien el del exito donde metieron un poco de gente y a unos los golpearon y a otros los ayudaron a salir...cierto, falta mostrar la historia completa, por cierto, hay que recordar quienes son los que usan gases y flashbangs!"
4235,"> Que busquen soluciones rapido y ya. Duque en que piensa porque tan lento????? A este paso lo que ocurrira es una Guerra Civil o algo porque las personas ya estan cansadas.

Si ambas partes dejaran la intransigencia sería mejor para todos."
4236,También la historia del país y por qué los colombianos siempre han estado peleando entre sí.
4237,"Pero dígame cómo controla uno a un montón de gente que aunque la mayoría está ejerciendo su derecho constitucional a la protesta, hay otros mal intencionados intentando hacer maldades? Pareciera que lo único que les sirve es que los policías les den las pistolas...realmente me parece muy triste que se aprovechen de un reclamo legítimo para hacer lo que les da la gana con los bienes de los demás, olvidamos que si bien la corrupción cuesta mucho al país, esto no ayuda en nada...se quejan por muchos afectados, pero están queriendo hacer pasar a la gente que ha luchado toda la vida para tener un negocio como pérdidas colaterales. Honestamente no es justo con el resto de gente, yo apoyo la movilización, personalmente he ido a varias...pero hasta aquí, he visto como los mismos manifestantes provocan a la policía, he visto que les tiran explosivos improvisados y he visto en primera plana el amarillismo más triste, ofensivo y denigrante. Le recuerdo que el fin no justifica los medios y si así están actuando por una causa,  por justa que sea, su forma de ser entonces no dista mucho del pensamiento del señor Uribe...hay que saber hacer las cosas y honestamente estamos actuando con dolo y estamos culpando al estado por ello...eso es caer muy bajo y personalmente yo me bajo de ese tren"
4238,"Exacto, también eso."
4239,"Voy a hacer algunas reflexiones que no denotan apoyo o rechazo a cierto tipo de protesta sino que busca explicar el por qué el pacifismo da paso a la violencia. Si entendemos las causas reales, eventualmente pudiéramos dar con respuestas efectivas. 

I. Para llegar a tu pregunta deberíamos cuestionarnos primero ¿para qué sirve la protesta? y más concretamente ¿para qué sirve la protesta pacífica y más en un país como Colombia? 

A mí me llama muchísimo la atención cuando la gente, como tú, dice que las personas tienen derecho a protestar de manera individual o colectiva sin afectar a los demás. Pero, honestamente ¿para qué sirve eso en un país como Colombia? ¿En un país donde se pierden 50 billones de pesos al año por concepto de corrupción, irrespetando todos los derechos habidos y por haber (el de la movilización por vías dañadas y puentes caidos, el de la salud y la educación por falta de recursos, etc.) qué va a importar el derecho a la protesta? ¿Un país en dónde el Fiscal General Barbosa acaba de retirar a la fiscal Amparo Ceron, quien llevaba 3 años investigando el caso Odebretch, un día después de que pidiera una reunión con la vicefiscal para informar que iba a llamar a indagatoria a Álvaro Uribe, a Andrés Pastrana y a Luis Carlos Sarmiento Angulo? 

""¡Ay! Apoyemos el derecho de esos ciudadanos a que pierdan su tiempo protestando frente a la Fiscalía General de la Nación de forma pacífica, una protesta que nadie va a ver porque de paso los medios de comunicación se van a limpiar el culo con ella y la van a ignorar por completo"".  

Entonces, acá apoyar la protesta pacífica es básicamente apoyar nada. Yo no digo que haya que apoyar la protesta violenta, pero pudiera uno ser más honesto y eliminar el derecho a la protesta pacífica y ya: nos ahorramos tiempo, esfuerzo y sueños vanos. Porque, además, el gobierno ha demostrado que, aún cuando acepte negociar con los protestantes pacíficos y llegue a acuerdos, estos acuerdos no va a tener intención de cumplirlos, como pasó con los acuerdos a los que se llegaron luego de las protestas de 2019. 


II. Hay una cosa de la que probablemente no estés al tanto, pero distintas estrategias de protesta como mecanismo para lograr cambios políticos y sociales son estudiadas e implementadas a lo largo del mundo y se verifica su efectividad permanentemente. Hace un poco menos de dos décadas comenzaron a suscitarse entre varias de las ex-repúblicas soviéticas un conjunto de movimientos insurgentes más o menos pacíficos (pero todos enarbolando la bandera de la no-violencia) que recibieron en su conjunto el nombre de Revoluciones de Colores. Esas revoluciones estuvieron fuertemente influenciadas por la obra de un tipo de nombre Gene Sharp. En todas estas revoluciones hubo la participación y financiación más o menos directa de organizaciones como USAID, NED, Freedom House, Soros Foundation, IRI, Albert Einstein Institution entre otros. 

Al principio las Revoluciones de Colores tuvieron éxito: en Georgia, Ukrania, Kirguistán, Líbano; pero luego empezaron a fracasar: Armenia, Azerbaiján, Moldavia, Uzbekistán, Bielorrusia, etc. Los gobiernos empezaron a idear formas para contrarrestar estos llamados ""golpes suaves"", en todos los casos con fuertes medidas represivas (viene a la mente Irán) pero en algunos casos a punta de plomo (como pasó en Bahrein). Es desafortunado, pero la protesta pacífica se devaluó aún más cuando se enarboló como mecanismo de cambio político, abrazando las demandas genuinas de la gente pero impulsado por motivos geopolíticos más amplios. 

Después de esto las siguientes revoluciones que vinieron todas han involucrado la fuerza de las armas y la violencia en conjunto con la protesta social: Siria, Irak, ~~Líbano~~ Libia (de hecho, todas las revoluciones de la llamada ""Primavera Árabe""). Acá en Latinoamérica tenemos lo que pasó en Honduras y en Bolivia, dos golpes de Estado que se consumaron sólo porque las fuerzas de seguridad del estado terminaron participando de forma activa en los derrocamientos. 

Entonces, el segundo punto es que, en los actuales momentos, lo que nos enseña la historia contemporánea es que la protesta pacífica se ha venido devaluando y que, por el contrario, la violencia genera mayores réditos. 


III. Lo tercero es que la historia también nos indica que los problemas económicos de la nación debilitan al gobierno, puede que la gente se canse ahorita de los protestantes pero la gente tiene una memoria histórica cortísima y a la final, en unos meses cuando todos los problemas de la contracción económica, la pandemia, etc. la gente va a culpar a Duque de su situación. Es famosa la frase de Richard Nixon a propósito de la situación económica en Chile durante el gobierno de Allende: ""Make the economy scream"" - o sea, que grite la economía. ¿Tú crees que la gente pensaba en Nixon y la CIA cuando subía la inflación a cifras de tres dígitos y la escasez producto de la especulación y el acaparamiento? Pensaban en Allende y su incapacidad por poner orden en el país (más allá de que le resultara imposible). Es precisamente por este motivo que lo primero que hace los EEUU cuando quiere sacudir un gobierno incómodo es poner sanciones económicas que lo debiliten y la gente se obstine, llámese Irán o Cuba o Venezuela. 

El punto es que la protesta que incomoda económicamente tiene más posibilidades de éxito que la que no. 

---

Mi posición es que no debería haber bloqueos ni violencia si existiesen formas correctas y respuestas adecuadas a las demandas de la población. A mí también me afectan los bloqueos y todo lo que ello implica así que mal pudiera yo estar de acuerdo. Sin embargo, entiendo la lógica detrás del por qué algunos civiles terminan cerrando vias y haciendo desmadres. Creo que es el Estado el que tiene la responsabilidad de hallar formas de tender puentes entre los distintos sectores de la sociedad para evitar llegar a estos extremos.

EDIT - Cosa que el Estado no sólo no está haciendo sino lo contrario, busca deslegitimar la propuesta minimizando la manifestación pacífica (masiva) y enfocándose en el bandidaje a la vez que los organismos de seguridad del Estado apelan sistemáticamente a la provocación con el fin de generar más violencia."
4240,"Me atrevo a decir que la gran mayoría de personas que apoyamos las protestas no está a favor de los bloqueos, ni son los que van a realizar actos vandálicos o bloqueos y demás. Estos son una fuerte minoría, con uno que otro policia infiltrado de por medio. La cuestión es que, estas personas también apoyan el paro, entonces todos creamos un estigma interno (ayudado por los medios de *des*información) de como las protestas no son este espacio de indignación, discusión, diversidad cultural y demás, sino que está predominantemente influenciado por los actos vandálicos, teniendo como resultado que la creencia de muchos que salir a protestar es apoyar dichos actos, y para algunos círculos más extremistas, incluso es sinónimo de ser vándalo o terrorista (!).

Yo personalmente lo apoyo, pero me entristece ver cosas como las historias de las personas que se han precarizado sus condiciones laborales, cuando queman un negocio pequeño, cuando asesinan a un policia, etc, pero aún más tristeza y rabia me genera ver a un  Estado garantizador de derechos quitar ojos e incluso asesinar a civiles, historias de personas que no pueden  acceder a un hospital, a sus pensiones, a una educación, o como se roban billones al año en corrupción (no apoyo los actos vandálicos, pero veo pertinente aclarar que este valor supera en varios ordenes de magnitud los gastos por reparación a la propiedad pública)."
4241,"Nadie apoya el vandalismo, pero es que solo a Duque se le ocurre meter más impuestos en plena pandemia y persuadir a la fuerza pública a usar la fuerza en contra de los ciudadanos.

Si los indígenas se sintieran escuchados no requerirían vías de hecho para salir en las noticias. Si ellos taponan las vías es porque el gobierno les hizo promesas de campaña y luego ni los vuelve a mirar. Los canales oficiales ya los agotaron hace rato.

Al gobierno simplemente no le da la gana mandar al presidente o a un ministro a negociar con el movimiento (no con la ""oposición"" de tibios que se inventaron), los delfines no se mezclan con la plebe.

Con dos visitas, con dar garantías así fuera a medias, se terminaban los bloqueos. Pero no les da la puta gana."
4242,"Creo que con los bloqueos y el vandalismo, los promotores del paro están empeorando las cosas.

Si van a presionar al gobierno, háganlo con inteligencia. Si van a hacer bloqueos, háganlos en edificios del gobierno, sedes de grandes compañías, sedes de partidos políticos, sedes de grandes medios de comunicación y casas de los ricos y los políticos.

La gracia es que se incomode a las élites políticas y económicas, **no a la ciudadanía del común**."
4243,"Yo siento que los Bloqueos en las carreteras desesperaron a la people y eso le quito poder a la Marcha. Aqui en mi barrio apoyaban eso y cuando vieron que ya no habia comida ahi se fueron contra los que marchan.  Se habria sostenido mas esto si hubiera sido solo en las ciudades. No estoy de acuerdo cuando las marchas se concentran en un solo lugar de la ciudad porque afectan a los negocios aleñados  como ocurrio en ibague. Deben moverse por distintos lugares. Tambien las marchas deberian concentrarse en los lugares donde viven los Politicos y miembros del gobierno. Porque no desesperar a los Politicos desde sus residencias? Vayan a los barrios mas ricos donde viven los congresistas y denles un susto. Ahi si se hacen las cosas.

Contra los bloqueos estoy totalmente en contra porque afecta mas de lo que ayuda. Aqui puse varios posts de lo malo que es para las personas que no tienen nada. Afecta a Campesinos y millones de negocios pequeños de toda indole. Se arma presion pero la s repercusiones economicas son peores. Aunque tambien esta justificado porque el gobierno en serio tiene muy abandonados a los Camioneros. Ya son muy pasados. Es tan solo ver los peajes tan caros que les ponen.

Contra el vandalismo no estoy de acuerdo pero pues eso pasa en todas las marchas worldwide. Creo tiene validez eso de que a veces es la unica forma que los gobiernos pongan atencion. Si hacen marchas pacificas al gobierno le vale \*\*\* asi de malos son los politicos, A ellos no le importa discutir pacificamente. Tristemente las personas se ven afectadas y eso tambien me parece fatal. Es una encrucijada contra la pared."
4244,"Los apoyo? No

Pero entiendo que las protestas pacíficas simplemente no nos van a llevar a nada, especialmente con la manada de corruptos que nos gobiernan."
4245,"...los bienes fisicos (edificios y demas) tienen seguros, de eso estoy muy seguro, por eso cuando dicen que los costos son, yeah, ya se que es propaganda..."
4246,"Las vías de hecho no son lo mejor en mi opinión, pero en cierto modo transmiten un mensaje diferente al de la propia protesta pacífica y deben ser entendidad en su contexto. 

De lo que estoy seguro, descartando la posibilidad de infiltrados, es que quien daña la propiedad privada o realiza bloqueos se siente agredido e ignorado por la sociedad en su conjunto, y esa cólera almacenada la expulsa de esa forma no sólo para hacerse notar sino para decir ""acá nadie se salva, ni ustedes"". Como tratando de meter la empatia por las malas al meter a los demás en su situación de precariedad (ojo, es mi hipótesis)"
4247,"Las protestas en pocas palabras, son una minoría imponiendo sus ideales sobre la mayoría. En este caso la mayoría voto por duque, y solo algo como 2 millones de personas están protestando, en su mayoría estudiantes sin experiencia laboral, económica o de vida. 

Para los que digan que es un movimiento masivo, si puede que lo sea, pero sigue siendo una minoría del país de 45 millones. 

Se ven mucho énfasis en los avisos policiales, que lastimosamente han habido, pero no se habla de la mayoría de protestas, con presencia de policía y ESMAD, que terminan sin altercados. Hablan de los policías que se pasan, pero no hablan de los daños a infraestructura que se han realizado por parte de los protestantes, no hablan de las pérdidas económicas en los privados que simplemente no pueden trabajar, dónde quedan sus derechos entonces?, Dónde quedó el derecho al trabajo de las personas que han sido despedidas por causa del paro? Considerando que cualquier ciudadano puede hacer una propuesta de ley, porque los líderes del paro no lo han hecho?

Hay acusaciones de que el gobierno quiere desacreditar el paro, pero todos los medios estatales ( teleantioquia, Canal 1, CityTv etcétera) están enfocados en remarcar las protestas pacíficas. Son los privados los que los desacreditan, porque no nos conviene, el paro genera perdidas económicas irreparables, hace más difícil importar o exportar, la calificación de riesgo del país se va a la mierda, lo que implica que no hay inversión extragera, es decir menos empleo, para los mismos que están protestando. 

Para empeorar, la ráfaga de falsa información en redes están jodiendo más toda la situación, ya ni siquiera saben porque están protestando. Va a pasar lo de siempre, el gobierno les dice que si a todo, y en dos años no cumple nada, porque su intención era detener el paro, no realizar una mejora de las situación del país. 

En conclusión, la protesta es por mucho la peor forma de participación ciudadana, es propensa a la intervención de mal intencionados, genera efectos secundarios severos y violenta los derechos de personas que no tienen interés en el tema. Si alguien quiere contradecir esto, por favor que mencioné otra forma de participación peor."

El problema es que el estado solo escucha a los ricos, los militares y las élites políticas y sociales. Si se lograra convencer a esa gente, el estado tal vez escuche."
4249,Pero como afectar a todo el pueblo bloqueando vías y no centrarse en los políticos va a ayudar a que se reduzca la corrupción?
4250,"Apoyo lo que dices pero voy un poco más allá.... todos los Tombos son unos hps y hay mucho bruto suelto defendiendo a los corruptos.

Los chinos de las primeras líneas son unos duros y tiene más huevos y ovarios que cualquiera. 

Es hora de que el pueblo despierte y pare de alimentar políticos zánganos que lo único que hacen es dividir el país para aprovechar y robarse lo que más pueden."
4251,"La mayoría ni salió a votar por Duque, ni petro y ni por el voto en blanco."
4252,">  Si se lograra convencer a esa gente, el estado tal vez escuche.
 
¿A los ricos, los militares y las élites políticas y sociales? ¿Cómo los vas a convencer? Se supone que son ellos los que tienen mejor educación, mejores oportunidades y no están tan agobiados por las vicisitudes. De hecho, esas élites se auto-denominan ""gente de bien"" (que por descarte significa que los que no piensen igual son ""gente de mal"" o algo así). 

Uno esperaría que las élites asumieran la responsabilidad de enderezar el país pero, desafortunadamente, el puesto se lo reparten entre los ultra snobs que aún creen que estamos en el Virreinato de Nueva Granada, los caporales que piensan que todo esto es una finca, los camanduleros y rezanderos de oficio y todos los recién vestidos que se han beneficiado de la cultura traqueta. 

Volvemos a lo mismo, no es culpa de la gente del común que el Estado no escuche la protesta pacífica. El Estado es el culpable, es precisamente su actuación la que propicia la degeneración de la protesta. 

Pues ya que el Estado no tiene intenciones de cambiar pues yo me resigné que a seguirán habiendo bloqueos y vandalismo, que es la evolución natural del conflicto ¿Qué se le va a hacer?"
4253,"Eso crea más descontento, y en términos generales es descontento con los políticos. En sí lo único que hace es meterles presión y les da un poco de temor en que la violencia escale en contra de ellos y sus bienes.

Además centrarse en la política no es un caso viable en nuestra actualidad, un ejemplo reciente es el plebiscito anti corrupción y votación por la paz."

Te digo mi opinión, la guerra ideológica acabó hace bastante años siendo generosos, acabó en el tratado de Paz, lo que hay ahora es una guerra contra las drogas y narcotraficantes que se escudan diciendo que luchan por cierta ideologia, y que es lo que pasa, que la guerra contra las drogas la perdimos cuando nos dimos cuenta que matar a los capos no sirvió para nada, y que para rematar no se combate el problema de raíz. 

Si el gobierno no invierte en infraestructura en el campo, vías, acceso, salud, educación, oportunidades laborales, los cultivos solo irán en aumento y de igual forma las ganancias de los narcos. Y eso es lo que ningún gobierno ha hecho. 

No digo que no hay que utilizar al ejercito, hay que seguir usandolo e invertir más en el, porque gente peligrosa siempre va a existir, pero el problema de las drogas va mucho más de combatirla con armas."

Hay muchas cosas que suponen un problema en lo que propone el mal llamado comite del paro, con algunas propuestas siendo, de entrada, francamente incumplibles (irrealizables). El ejemplo mas obvio es la peticion de ""no discriminacion por genero, diversidad sexual y etnica"" . ¿Como planean hacer que eso se cumpla?, ¿acaso quieren que se encarcele a cualquier ciudadano que exhiba alguna conducta discriminatoria contra alguno de los grupos en cuestion hasta que la gente sienta miedo o algo asi?. Por mas educacion que haya al respecto o castigo al irrespeto a dichas normas, siempre va a haber alguien que rechace cualquier codigo implementado para proteger a esos grupos y exhiba esas conductas de una u otra forma y en cualquier escenario. El gobierno podria hacer de su parte dentro de las instituciones que lo componen pero, ¿como se asegura el cumplimiento por parte de la sociedad?

Otra cosa en el mismo sentido es que quieren mayores beneficios sociales pero, ¿como esperan que se paguen si no quieren asumir mas cargas tributarias?. Si, ya hemos oido a Petro, a Wilson Arias y compañia hablando de que se le cobre mas impuestos al sector financiero y los grandes capitales y eso esta bien, pero hay un limite porque, de lo contrario, esa gente simplemente va a recoger la plata que maneja y se va a ir a otro lado con ella. Tambien hay discusiones sobre combatir la evasion fiscal y la corrupcion pero los resultados en estos frentes no se verian de la noche a la mañana. Fuera de eso, Petruchis y compañia hablan de otros mecanismos de financiacion como imprimir dinero, prestamos del Banco de la Republica y reversa a beneficios tributarios para algunos grupos; sin embargo, ¿es suficiente dinero para todo?, ¿son fiables los mecanismos destinados a la recaudacion de ese dinero? o ¿está garantizada su fiabilidad en el tiempo?.

Los impuestos son necesarios y debe haber mayor equidad en la asignacion de la carga tributaria en el sentido de que cada quien tiene que pagar de acuerdo a sus capacidades, pero no puede hablarse de menos impuestos para un gasto publico cada vez mayor.

Tambien esta el tema de la legitimacion del vandalismo, el terrorismo antiestatal  y anticiudadano y de quienes cometen estos actos al equipararlos con los que salen pacificamente a protestar, mientras se deslegitima el actuar de la fuerza publica de forma generalizada, por parte de elementos involucrados en este paro.

&#x200B;

no gustes ni disgustes y todo estará claro.  
Si quieres la verdad clara frente a ti, nunca estés a favor o en contra.  
El conflicto entre a favor y en contra es la peor enfermedad de la mente.”

4289,"> El ejemplo mas obvio es la peticion de ""no discriminacion por genero, diversidad sexual y etnica"" . 

Nadie espera que el Estado pueda garantizar, por ejemplo, el derecho a la vida en un 100% de la población (sería una belleza que en un país como Colombia hubiese cero homicidios), eso no impide que esté planteado en las leyes y los programas de gobierno (y sus actuaciones) al menos como un *desideratum*. 

>pero hay un limite porque, de lo contrario, esa gente simplemente va a recoger la plata que manejan y se va a ir a otro lado con ella. 

Lo hermoso del concepto de libre mercado es que, si existe demanda de algo (por ejemplo de servicios financieros) el sistema incentiva el que otros ofrezcan sus servicios y así obtengan ganancias (por el cuento de la racionalidad de los entes económicos). La banca es tan buen negocio que, te lo aseguro, si se van esos que dices vendrán otros a ocupar su lugar. 

>¿es suficiente dinero para todo?, ¿son fiables los mecanismos destinados a la recaudacion de ese dinero? o ¿está garantizada su fiabilidad en el tiempo?

Pues lo mismo pudiera decirse de las medidas que había planteado anteriormente el gobierno. Duque pretendía que alguien estrato cuatro (la clase media) pagase 19% de más en sus cuentas de servicios, empezase a declarar renta (porque uno esperaría que ganase más de 1.6MM de pesos al año), empezase a pagar IVA por todos esos otros rubros que antes estaban exentos y, de paso, encajase la inflación que iba a venir cuando todos los productos subiesen de precio por razones obvias y todo lo demás que dejé por fuera. ¿Cuántos de esos estrato cuatro iban a quedar luego en el estrato tres? ¿En dónde crees tú que igual van a recaer los impuestos cuando se amplíe aún más la inequidad económica (de la que Colombia está en el top 5 del mundo) y quede un país sólo de pobres y ultra ricos?

Igual hay muchas otras estrategias de recaudación que van más allá de lo que estás planteando. Hay mucho dinero en Colombia pero, desafortunadamente, muy mal distribuido."
4290,">Ni siquiera es protestar por derecho, sino cuando se usan las protestas y los clamores populares justificados para impulsar una narrativa especifica y hacer exigencias no apegadas a la realidad por el grado de imposibilidad para ser cumplidas a cabalidad.

¿De donde sacas que no es por derecho? creo que entiendo lo que decís con la narrativa especifica, pero creo que igual es parte de una democracia que suficiente cantidad de personas se pongan de acuerdo para hacer un reclamo. No creo que se trate de ""manipulación"" de la opinión pública, en todo caso eso lo ejercen los medios tradicionales.


>  El ejemplo mas obvio es la peticion de ""no discriminacion por genero, diversidad sexual y etnica"" . ¿Como planean hacer que eso se cumpla?, ¿acaso quieren que se encarcele a cualquier ciudadano que exhiba alguna conducta discriminatoria contra alguno de los grupos en cuestion hasta que la gente sienta miedo o algo asi?.

La propuesta debe estar mejor formulada que esto. si tenés algún documento que comente cual sería el procedimiento sería muy instructivo, porque estaríamos suponiendo sobre la nada. 

> Otra cosa en el mismo sentido es que quieren mayores beneficios sociales pero, ¿Cómo esperan que se paguen si no quieren asumir mas cargas tributarias?.

Las financiaciones estatales se pueden hacer de muchas formas, en este momento igual ya hay una carga impositiva sobre las grandes empresas, pero hay muchísimo despilfarre gubernamental y súmale a eso la corrupción, creo que esta clarísimo que el estado podría recaudar más y gastar menos habiendo tantos mecanismos y formas de hacerlo sin perjudicar tanto a las clases media y baja. No pensar en todas estas variables es un error grave.

Deslegitimar el acto de la fuerza publica no es legitimar el vandalismo, hace la cuenta respecto a cuantos policías / manifestantes muertos hay y es un dato más que completo para hacerte entender la gravedad de la situación, sumando a esto desapariciones forzadas, violaciones y heridos.

* Unos liberales no querian a Gaviria tampoco y fundaron cambio radical (y Lleras se lo trago).

4326,"Yo le dije lo mismo, pero según él, pone información de los dos lados, de igual forma creo que toda esa información lo único que hace es invisibilizar lo que pasa realmente como vos decís, mi punto es que si le seguimos respondiendo con bronca por la indignación que genera nunca va a estar abierto a darse cuenta del daño q hace ni va a estar abierto a cambiar de opinión."
4327,"de hecho creo que duque es una muestra de las contradicciones que hablamos es una mezcla de elementos de izquierda y derecha fallidos, la peor reforma tributaria ever y no es que no fuera necesaria pero habian formas de buscar recortar el gasto pero nadie tiene los cojones de hacerlo"
4328,"o te sueltan a las abejas o a los perros, o a los perros que escupen abejas (?

Teorías hay muchas, para mi la más probable es la de que están todos cohercionados por el cartel y los paras. Al menos acá en Colombia. Duque actúa como un títere.

La gente también bloquea las ciudades porque es la única forma popular conocida que funcionó alguna vez para hacerle reclamos a un gobierno.

Estoy de acuerdo en que debe haber una más eficiente, pero si lo van a hacer, tienen derecho a hacerlo."
4329,es que ahí en ese congreso el que no esta cagado en amenazas es una basura que le importa un carajo llenarse el bolsillo con el dinero de las arcas públicas.
4330,"mmmm No diria que tienen derecho porque se estan extralimitando y violentando los derechos del resto de la poblacion. El hecho que no tengan suficiente visibilidad es cierto pero no los autoriza. Honestamente no veo diferencia entre ""bloquean porque no los escuchan""  y ""robaba porque tenia hambre"".

Cada dia que pasa el bloqueo se polariza mas la situacion. Ya algunos se radicalizaron y ya hay muertos y heridos porque la poblacion civil se levanto. Si los bloqueos no se controlan simple y llanamente vamos a guerra civil (aunque aun falta bastante). Ya tenemos muy mala experiencia con los grupos paramilitares, lo que menos necesitamos es que un grupo se tome el ""derecho"" de violentar a otros y grupos de empresarios se reunan y decidan financiar a otros grupos de defensa.

Antes teniamos un grupo que se sentia oprimido (violentado olvidado, etc). Ahora tenemos ADICIONALMENTE un grupo que se siente oprimido por otro y por la inaccion del ejecutivo. Como crees que va a ser la proxima vez que haya convocatoria a paro ? consideras de verdad que los ciudadanos van a quedarse callados viendo como se prepara una nueva destruccion del mobiliario urbano y se preparan bloqueos ? es una linea muy, muy peligrosa la que estamos trazando.
 
Cual crees que va a ser la linea principal de los candidatos a elecciones ? los candidatos los elige el pueblo por ser masa (manipulada o no) pero el ejecutivo gobierna con la clase alta porque en el sistema capitalista si las empresas no colaboran se cae el sistema. Entonces ... necesitan de parte y parte y en mi opinion, en general (no todos) las acciones del ejecutivo estan causando resentimiento y desconfianza, mas aun, en las clases media y alta. Y un sistema capitalista sin esas clases se friega."
4331,yo creo que habria que ir a hacer trancazos y manifestaciones a casa de los del congreso y porque no hasta saquearles las casas se lo merecen por hdp
4332,"> Cual crees que va a ser la linea principal de los candidatos a elecciones ? los candidatos los elige el pueblo por ser masa (manipulada o no) pero el ejecutivo gobierna con la clase alta porque en el sistema capitalista si las empresas no colaboran se cae el sistema.

Esto es indiscutible y no podría estar más de acuerdo, de hecho, si hubiera más clase media y alta recaudarían muchísimo más y se evitarían todo este lío. Pero las protestas son justamente porque no hay forma de escalar. En Colombia se necesitan entre 5 y 9 generaciones para salir de la pobreza, ¿y cómo van a reclamar los pobres? ¿votando y participando del mismo sistema que los margina? 

No te digo que no entiendo tu punto. Tu punto es claro, no hay necesidad de vandalizar y frenar la economía del país.
Pero esos actos los perpetua en su mayoría gente radical, gente radical que existe por proposiciones como ""no tienen derecho a protestar"" ""son todos vandalos"" ""son todos ratas y guerrilleros"" lo único que hacen esas declaraciones son echar más leña al fuego. ¿Querés que dejen de cortar las rutas y romper negocios? Habría que escuchar que tienen para decir. Pero en vez de eso le disparan incluso a gente que no esta participando de estos actos vandálicos que justamente existen porque no los escuchan.

Es peligroso pensar de una manera tan tajante respecto a los derechos de los demás, porque crea esta generalización para desacreditar marchas por culpa de un porcentaje pequeño de gente resentida y enojada (y con razón) porque si estuvieras en su lugar nunca dirías algo como ""se están extralimitando""."
4333,"De acuerdo. Lo que quiero resaltar es que en mi opinion, la situacion es menos buena hoy en general. 

Si la protesta no hubiera vandalizado las ciudades, si el MIO en cali no hubiera sido quemado, si las ciudades no estuvieran bloqueadas, me atrevo a decir que hoy habria mas apoyo general a la protesta. Casi todos los colombianos la apoyamos pero cuando empezo el vandalismo, la violencia y los bloqueos, el apoyo popular se disminuyo. Hay grupos que la apoyan claro, pero anda a Cali y pregunta hoy como se siente con el paro y como se sentian hace dos semanas y va a ser una gran diferencia.

Perdieron las ciudades que tienen mobiliario urbano destruido. Perdieron los empresarios que no pueden sacar sus productos, perdio el pueblo que se quedo sin empleo y sin transporte. Lo peor ? el pueblo no tiene plan b mientras las clases medias les duele pero pueden pagar comida al doble de precio.

Manana negocian, los dirigentes del paro se vuelven parte del ejecutivo, reciben su tajada y el pueblo quedo endeudado, las ciudades destruidas y la clases media y altas quedaron dolidas y resentidas. No vamos a ganar nada asi, en total vamos a perder mas.

Respondo tu pregunta que sospecho es sarcastica: si, los pobres (y los ricos) reclaman VOTANDO. Haciendo uso del poder mas bravo que existe que es ese voto. Pero me atrevo a jurar que al menos el 50% (yo creeria que mas) no votaron ni votaran para marzo 2022. Esa accion vale mucho (ha sido la base de varias guerras desde el feudalismo, la colonia, etc.) pero si venden su consciencia ... no se puede hacer mucho, tenemos el pais que nos merecemos.

Ivan Ospina, alcalde de Cali no es santo de mi devocion pero hay que reconocerle algo: ha hecho todo lo posible, demasiado en opinion de muchos, para escuchar los miembros del paro. Y solo ha recibido maltrato, amenazas e injurias. Los miembros del paro timidamente dicen que no apoyan la violencia. Repito, TIMIDAMENTE. Apoyan los bloqueos de la economia bajo lo que se podria entender como una mentalidad: ""que se jodan todos, que sufran lo que sufrimos, no se que somos pobres y nadie nos oye ?""

Un pais no lo vamos a construir con esos pensamientos, al menos no uno bueno."

Porfa, no. Porfa busca en el diccionario. Yo sé que Duque tiene el cerebro liso, y por lo propio no llega al fascismo. Por mediocre que sea el gobierno, no es equiparable a Italia en 1943."
4339,Monumento fascista????? Te puedes explicar o solo repites lo que todo el mundo dice....
4340,¿Cómo se llama el monumento?
4341,Manada de burros
4342,r/dontdeadopeninside
4343,"Sí. Las representa. Su construcción representa una maniobra típica de los gobiernos de corte autoritario: preparar un gran teatro gastando una plata considerable para inaugurar un monumento nacionalista mientras en el campo los militares cagan a tiros a campesinos que protestaban. Se construyó en el contexto de La Violencia y del surgimiento de las Farc, del envío de soldados colombianos sin motivo alguno a morir en la Guerra de Correa.

Un monumento fascista no te dice: ""Viva el fascismo"". Un monumento fascista celebra el nacionalismo militar, como Mussolini celebraba al Imperio romano para crear un sustento histórico artificial de su movimiento. Todo eso mientras se desvía la atención de otras cosas que podía hacer el gobierno o, lo que es lo mismo, mientras se le lava el cerebro a la gente para hacerles creer que lo que están haciendo sus gobernantes (inaugurar monumentos, matar campesinos, enviar soldados inocentes a Corea) es un deber patriótico."
4344,"Que fue construido por uno.... De resto, ni mierda mas"
4345,"Creo que toca aprender a leer antes. No le dije fascista a Duque, le dije fascista al monumento.

Y es fascista porque Laureano Gómez, presidente nazi que tuvimos, se lo comisionó a un artista italiano que trabajó para Mussolini y era seguidor de él. El monumento es literalmente fascista. Saludos."
4346,"no ni a palos, es peor, porque por lo menos en ese tiempo la gente lo podía percibir, ahora no."
4347,"Laureano Gómez le comisionó ese monumento a un fascista italiano simpatizante de Mussolini que había inmigrado a Colombia, se llamaba Angiolo Mazzoni.

El que lo mandó hacer y el que lo ejecutó eran efectivamente fascistas."
4348,Ese es el Monumento a los Héroes.
4349,[removed]
4350,"Osea el monumento que fue diseñado por el presidente para honorar a los soldados que fueron a Corea para batallar a los COMUNISTAS es fascista.... Pero después nunca fue construido porq si no me equivoco lo tumbó Pinilla y lo cambio a algo más ""modesto"" .... que igual fue por la independencia de Colombia.... Aún no veo que tiene de ""fascista"" este monumento. Excepto quien lo construyó era fascista.... si todo lo que representa es muy Anti fascista.... Lo único que te haces base es que fue diseñado por un fascista osea que el sentimiento y todo es fascista... Ahh claro....."
4351,"Ajá y qué? El simbolismo del monumento que representa no tiene nada que ver con el facismo ni con la creencia del artista. Es decir que si el man que le puso las letras es nazi, el man que puso la base de cemento es soviético, y el que hizo el molde de las estatuas es antisemita, entonces el monumento es facista-nazi-comunista-antisemita?

4357,"Es un monumento nacionalista en la década de 1940 hecho por un conservador con nexos al falangismo, nazismo y fascismo. La arquitectura (el diseño como tal, ya separándolo del escultor) también se llama fascista, de manera que artísticamente también tiene ese adjetivo. No sabía que les preocupara tanto jaja.

>Es decir que si el man que le puso las letras es nazi, el man que puso la base de cemento es soviético, y el que hizo el molde de las estatuas es antisemita, entonces el monumento es facista-nazi-comunista-antisemita?

Eso es un hombre de paja porque yo no estoy hablando de los constructores, estoy hablando de los autores intelectuales de la obra. Los que se sentaron a decidir que debía haber un monumento nacionalista en pleno período de resurgimiento del nacionalismo, y luego decidir que el indicado para hacer eso debía ser alguien que trabajó para uno de los mayores nacionalistas entonces. No nos hagamos los bobos.

Solo estoy describiendo una obra (contextualizándola en la historia y en su movimiento artístico) y lo que pasó ahí ayer; esa foto me pareció una ironía y cierto triunfo, al menos cultural, contra unos dirigentes tradicionalmente conservadores. No estoy diciendo que lo tengan que tumbar ni estoy haciendo juicios de valor, de ninguna manera se puede insinuar por mi post, estoy DESCRIBIENDO. Cómo les duele, por Dios."
4358,"El escarabajo es un vehículo famosamente nazi, sí. ¿Y?"
4359,"Es un error de apreciación totalmente el suyo.

1. Piensa que hice un juicio de valor cuando no fue así
2. Utilicé un adjetivo para calificar una obra que histórica, política y hasta artísticamente se puede describir como ""fascista"". Si no les gusta que se defina histórica o políticamente como fascista (sabrá Dios por qué no, además de ese afán petulante de corregir a anónimos en internet porque dudo que estén en contra de las reuniones en Los Héroes) entonces deben aceptar, por lo menos, que artísticamente sí tiene ese adjetivo.
3. Por alguna razón todos los que empezaron a responder creen que como yo llamé ""fascista"" al monumento entonces yo defiendo no volverlo a usar o demolerlo o algo por el estilo, poniendo un montón de falsas equivalencias y más falacias para contradecir cosas que yo no dije y haciendo mucha gimnasia mental para interpretar siete palabras que escribí. ¿Qué tenía que ver que la Fanta o el Escarabajo, o las Autobahn o el Estadio de Berlín sean creaciones nazis? En ningún momento dije que no se deban usar, de hecho me parece un triunfo de la historia el hecho que gente contraria a las ideas nazistas o fascistas son las que utilizan la Autobahn y ocupan el Estadio de Berlín.

Si solo son capaces de ver simbolismo en el Muro de Berlín o en la Esvástica pues les falta mil capas más de profundidad para cavar. Al fin y al cabo a este país le falta eso: simbolismo, identidad, pero identidad en la lucha sobre todo. Normalizamos tanto las matanzas y los gobiernos conservadores amigos del autoritarismo que se les hace escandaloso cuando uno adjetiva de fascista un monumento público nacionalista ordenado por el gobierno durante La Violencia, como si el hecho de que la construcción del mayor monumento de Bogotá no implicara cierto performance teatral (con todo lo que una inauguración de esas implica en los medios) para cubrir cómo se trataba a los campesinos, al propio estilo dictatorial.

Por cierto, si no logran ver las similitudes entre el Monumento a los Héroes y la [EUR en Roma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EUR,_Rome#Architecture) pues tienen tanta miopía mental que no solo les nubló la ideología sino que les afectó la vista.

>La estructura construye un marco simétrico sobre el eje central del monumento, de modo que exterioriza los criterios geométricos que esconde, reconocibles entre otros aspectos por la monumentalidad de la escalera central, la proporción, la carencia de vanos perimetrales y la sensación de hermetismo de una pieza fundidas completa en concreto reforzado **y que se erige con unos de los pocos vestigios que existen en Colombia de una arquitectura emparentada con la ideología fascista.**

1. La consecuencia de las protestas recae sobre los manifestantes y el gobierno está en el deber de emplear los medios a su alcance para restituir el orden público. Ello vindicaría la actuación de Maduro y de Chávez antes de él. 

2. La consecuencia de las protestas recae sobre el gobierno que no quiere ceder a las demandas sociales. Ello condenaría la actuación de Duque durante esta crisis.

&#x200B;

"""""" Paso 4: busca atraer, no dominar 

Cada movimiento busca corregir alguna injusticia, por lo que es fácil caer en la trampa de demonizar al otro lado. Sin embargo, aquí es donde muchos movimientos se descarrilan. La ira es un movilizador eficaz, pero la ira sin esperanza es una fuerza destructiva. Necesita presentar un caso afirmativo con tácticas afirmativas. Por eso es mejor comenzar con metas pequeñas y alcanzables. Los aliados de Gandhi cuestionaron su idea de hacer del impuesto a la sal un foco principal del movimiento de independencia de la India, porque estaban a favor de un plan para un cambio integral, pero vio que un solo problema, incluso uno pequeño, podría unificar la nación y romper el monopolio del Raj británico. en el poder.  Las tácticas baratas, fáciles de replicar y de bajo riesgo son las que tienen más probabilidades de éxito. Son la forma en que puede movilizar los números que necesita para influir en un pilar de poder, ya sea que esa influencia sea disruptiva, movilizadora o sacando a la gente del medio del espectro de aliados, especialmente si sus tácticas se consideran positivas y de buen humor.  Es muy probable que bloquear calles y tirar piedras a la policía ahuyente a los que están en medio de su espectro de aliados y hará que sea decididamente más difícil obtener el apoyo de las instituciones dentro de los pilares del poder. Durante las elecciones presidenciales estadounidenses de 2016, por ejemplo, los ""Bernie bros"" pueden haber enfurecido a los partidarios más fervientes de Bernie Sanders, pero probablemente desanimaron a muchos de los que necesitaba desesperadamente ganarse.

4420,"Si hablan mierda, sólo un lado de la historia. Hoy andaban circulando videos de grupos de vándalos tirando piedras a las entradas del portal del prado para meterse. Para algo tienen que traer al ESMAD. También en la plaza de la Paz grandes grupos de personas tirando piedras a la policía."
4421,"Ojo que hay que tener en cuenta que ya habian reportes en el Centro Comercial (portal del prado, que hoy no abrió por las marchas), de que se estaban queriendo meter personas, cuando la cosa empezó a agravarse la policia/Esmad tomaron acción. Ojala se calmen los ánimos.

&#x200B;

Se venia marchando bien en Barranquilla (pacíficamente), lastima que algunos van con otras intenciones aprovechando las marchas... :(

&#x200B;

En otros videos hay gente sentada o al lado del Esmad y no hay ningun problema ya que saben que son civiles que no estan involucrados.  Ojala se calmen los ánimos."

4427,"No sé lo del niño, pero si han muerto varias personas, entre eso un compañero de donde trabaja antes murió ayer"
4428,"Lo siento por tu compañero, que le pasó?"
4429,"Pues según cuentan habían personas robando a los que estaban protestando y empezaron a darse bala y el cayó, es muy triste todo, el pueblo debería de unirse y no intentar sacar ventaja de las manifestaciones"
4430,A mi honestamente me harta que cada vez que hay una marcha todos terminamos en el mismo ciclo vicioso de decir que es una forma legitima de protesta y que no. Y pues se puede condenar la violencia (que es lo mas logico) pero al mismo tiempo es como lo mas facil de hacer.cualquiera puede hacer eso . Deberiamos hablar mas bien de porque es que siempre pasa la misma mierda o no c
4431,"Uy no tampoco. Esto me recuerda cuando estaba en la Universidad Publica y los encapuchados que supuestamente luchaban por la justicia del pueblo. Trataban horriblemente a los estudiantes-las personas-los profesores cada vez que hacian tropel.  Una vez estabamos entre las papas bombas y ni siquiera nos querian dejar salir.   


Es importante luchar contra las injusticias que hace el gobierno pero esto si es fatal. En la proxima marcha si se ve algun vandalo todos deberian irse contra el con palos. Que las marchas sean pacificas y shame a los que hacen estos actos."
4432,"Let me guess, Cali?"
4433,Eso es vandalismo
4434,Que vergüenza me da a veces la gente de este país.

4443,"A ver pensemos en el caso del banco: la gente que lo destruye piensa
Ja les hice un daño
Enorme ! 
La realidad es que en ese banco está : los cajeros , las señoras del tinto, el celador. Pero como quemaron el
Banco esa gente se queda sin trabajo. Así que a la larga se afectan más familias porque pierden la
Fuente de ingresos. Quieren protestar ? No compren en súper mercados
De cadena , no hagan transacciones bancarias si pueden, no salgan a trabajar. Paren un día o dos y así entienden. Pero la destruccion lo
Único que hace es arruinarnos más."

Tristeza que se aprovechen de esto o quien sabe si son grupos hechos para deslegitimar la protesta, en cambio las marchas que se graban por la 5ta y otras zonas van tranquilas con música y gente expresando su descontento contra el gobierno pacíficamente. 

y como gritan por las calles ""LOS BUENOS SOMOS MÁS!"""
4446,"Si se trata de un banco no veo el problema, cuando uno ve quienes son los primeros en recibir auxilio del desgobierno y quienes son los que diseñan las soluciones economicas....nop, el sistema financiero en Polombia es tan culpable de la situación actual como el desgobierno"

En este caso, es un banco, ¿por qué defienden los establecimientos que no les importan las personas? ¿por qué defienden los establecimientos que tienen capacidad para pagar seguros? ¿por qué es tan importante lo material? tambien dejo claro que en la mayoria de protestas la policia infiltra e incita a los jovenes que tienen rabia a destruir; conozco personas de la dijin que ese es su trabajo, al igual que del ejercito y la policia."
4457,Seguro son policías encubiertos.

Cosa. Después se andan quejando
Cuando la policía va y los coge. Aquí incendiaron varios buses del mío, una estación, la oficina de la dian ( había empleados allí) , saquearon almacenes, robaron almacenes de motos, robaron el
Éxito de la Simón Bolívar pero hubo marchantes que alcanzaron a recuperar y regresar cosas. 
Ojalá nos dejen a la PM permanente porque el alcalde soquete que tenemos en Cali de seguridad nada."

Será que van a soltar ese negocito tan melo"
4467,"Creo que el punto del vídeo y la discusión en general que se trataba de fomentar, era acerca de que, aunque este justificado el descontento de las personas, no hay razones para atemorizar, herir o perjudicar de alguna manera a la gente del común. Usted mismo pudo escuchar el temor de la mujer del video, que gracias a Dios no le pasó a mi madre ni a alguien de mi familia, pero si le pasó a alguien más. Por los miedos que he pasado por el egoísmo, desesperación o simple avaricia de otro, me gustaría no le pasará a nadie más. 

No me mal entienda, considero que la protesta era necesaria, pues las injusticias ya son tan claras y evidentes que pareciera ni siquiera intentarán disimular,  pero bajo ninguna razón otra persona, en sus mismas condiciones, tenga que salir lastimada por otro que quiere expresar su enojo."

Sin embargo, esta no es la manera, ciertamente. Ojalá todos podamos aspirar a una calidad de vida mejor con dirigentes decentes en un futuro cercano."
4475,"Ni tanto, mire japon, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eK--oCVP18A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eK--oCVP18A) la diferencia esta en la cultura y educacion general de la gente. Eso en nuestro pais hace mucho se perdio."

Las empresas grandes para eso tienen seguro, en unos días tendrán un cheque en la mano, por las empresas grandes no me siento mal. Lo que si me siento mal es de la gente que trabaja en esos negocios grande/pequeños. Que trabajo tendrán el día de mañana? Que pesar.

Destruyen a donde lo mandan ?"
4482,"Literal usted tiene razón, el guarda es reubicado porque generalmente la seguridad es tercerizada, lo mismo la persona del aseo, y generalmente tanto el inmueble como lo que se almacena esta asegurado, el daño mas bien es para la aseguradora.

Edit: Además esas en posiciones tercerizadas guardas / empleados de aseo generalmente siempre necesitan personal porque alguien se enferma / se accidenta / tiene calamidades domesticas etc...

Elucubrando, a la persona del banco seguramente la pongan a cubrir turnos en otros lugares."
4483,"Creo yo que es una cosa romper vidrios y demas, y otra causar daños fisicos a alguien, en este caso el manager del banco tiene toda la culpa, sabiendo que hay una protesta lo que prima es la seguridad de los individuos, pero que mejor ejemplo del absoluto desinterés y falta de caracter ético y moral de estas instituciones que hacerlos ir a trabajar sin importar las consecuencias. En un pais como Polombia a los bancos no les interesa que les rompan los vidrios, asalten a sus empleados y demas, lo material esta asegurado por aseguradoras (que en su mayoria son de su propiedad) y si no el desgobierno les cubre los daños, respecto a los empleados....cual es el costo de contratar a alguien nuevo?, lamentablemente que alguien sufriera heridas si es el caso, pero es solo una muestra del valor de los individuos en una sociedad tan podrida como la de Polombia, lo mejor es que con todo y paro el desgobierno seguirá con su ""reforma"", solo queda esperar que lo que venga sea peor por que desafortunadamente no se ve otra salida."
4484,Usted es la clase de narcisistas que termina dañado a este país. 60% de la población en pobreza y usted ve una protesta en contra de una reforma que les pasa por encima como un acto de vandalismo. Usted debería retirarse de toda forma de comunicacion y dejar que las personas con un mínimo de empatia de hecho logre opinar.
4485,"Bueno, y qué pasó hoy? Cuáles son las cifras? Cuántos saqueos? Cuántas casas destruidas? Lo leo hablando de forma muy emocional. No veo datos."

Video, obras del gobierno como los baños pùblicos y los centros de reciclaje los ayudan a tener vidas más dignas."
4488,"Sí, los pequeños negocios y en general los bienes públicos deben ser protegidos. Pero un banco? En Colombia? Donde historicamente han hecho lo imposible para que el gobierno los salve de la ruina con nuestra plata al mismo tiempo que se eximen de impuestos que usted y yo terminamos pagando (vease: cuarenta reformas tributarias en setenta años)

4490,[deleted]
4491,Pues tenia entendido que una de las principales razones de la marcha de ayer era para que no se le subieran los impuestos a nadie.
4492,Y cuántos dias va a durar el banco dañado?
4493,Y no solo eso. El banco lo arreglan y ya. Durará un dia o dos cerrado y ya todos vuelven a lo suyo. Cuántos bancos en la historia del país han cerrado una sede despues de un tropel?
4494,"De que habla usted?, desde cuando protestar se convirtió en sinónimo de hacer mierda los servicios públicos y destruir locales? Usted seguro es uno de esos vándalos que no tienen empatia por lo que destruyen, le cuento que todos esos buses y locales destruidos no se arreglaran por obra y gracia, usted debería retirarse de toda forma de comunicación y dejar que las personas con un mínimo de empatia y sentido de pertenencia logre opinar"

4496,"Si, bueno... Tampoco soy amiga de una besatón o a convertirme en Gandhi. Pero me gustaría que las cosas fueran más ""civilizadas"". Algo muy utópico dadas las circunstancias."
4497,Si pero esas personas tenían miedo de morir y muchas personas son cajeros y si los roban quien paga? El banco? El dueño de ese banco? No sale de sus pagas y si mueren y tienen familia ?
4498,"Parce los dueños de grandes empresas, bancos, etc tienen la capacidad, medios y dinero para sencillamente cerrar, largarse y abrir en otro lad, lo hemos visto suceder muchas veces, por eso mismo no entiendo por que atacan negocios pequeños y medianos. Son gente que talvez no puedan recuperarse, mucho menos bajo las condiciones actuales, protestar está bien, vandalismo no, mucho menos a pequeños y medianos negocios."
4499,Porqué esta historia suena a historia falsa para dar lástima? 🤔
4500,"A ver le cuento: en Cali el año pasado quemaron dos bancos ; 1 ya lo abrieron después de como dos meses , el otro aún no lo abren porque pues lo destruyeron todo. Los que trabajaban en ese se quedaron sin empleo. Lo sé porque la cuñada de una amiga trabajaba allí y no pudieron ubicarla en otra sucursal. Una familia que quedó sin ingresos ."
4501,"Los pequeños locales están siendo atacados por la pomicia. El transporte público es tan caro que una persona trabajadora no se puede montar. De nuevo, esos daños los hace la policía, y si usted cree que soy un vandalo por decirle a la cara que un gobierno entero lo convence a usted que las protestas están mal usando a agentes de la fuerza pública, pues si soy un vandalo, mientras que usted solo se sienta dejando que que el país se venga abajo por su propia condesencia. Retirese."
4502,"Esos buses, aparte de que son un sistema fallido, son de un operador privado. Eso lo paga una aseguradora privada."
4503,"Bueno y los robaron? Hay denuncias? Les hicieron algo. Cagada el miedo a morir, pero esto es Colombia. Vivir con miedo es lo que nos toca a todos. Da tristeza pero es así."
4504,"Sí, los negocios pequeños y los bienes públicos deben ser protegidos.

pero deje la fantasía. Los bancos jamás se van a ir de Colombia. Tienen uno de los margenes de intermediacion más altos del mundo. Al nivel de Africa. Será que van a soltar esa tetica tan deliciosa que somos los colombianos, que hasta en una pandemia nos arrodillamos para rescatarlos a ellos de primeros.

Me puede decir cuáles son las muchas veces en que se ha visto eso suceder, por favor?"

4506,"Los vándalos siempre han existido, no es como que se generan mágicamente cada protesta y después de la protesta desaparecen, o usted cree que el término ""Vandalismo"" es exclusivo para las protestas?, pueden haber policías vandalizando, como también gente a la  que les gusta destruir cosas, lo llame vándalo por concluir que voy en contra de la protesta porque no apoyo el Vandalismo, además ese argumento de que ""los buses son muy caros y no se pueden montar la gente trabajadora"" entonces por eso esta bien destruirlos?





Nadie cree que las protestas están mal, lo que está mal es el Vandalismo"
4507,[deleted]
4508,"Eso mismo decían los Venezolanos que no se irían, que no sucedería, ya sabemos el resto...y si vamos por lo que dice no se va el banco como tal, pero sus dueños si y los fregados seguimos siendo nosotros, pa lo que les importa, mientras que pequeño negocios son los negocios de la gente que uno conoce, amigos de uno, familiares que se han esforzado para tener lo que tienen, eso que hicieron no fue más que vandalismo y la embarraron, todo comenzó bien hasta que comenzaron con eso."
4509,“Conocido” tiene 170.000 seguidores 😅
4510,"Todos esos SITM son el gran robo del uribismo. El operador se queda con el 95% de las ganancias y la ciudad con 5%, pero la ciudad construye las vias y las estaciones. El robo del siglo. Que ardan. Por algo en todas las ciudades los SITM los entregaron a medias, llenos de elefantes blancos, estan quebrados, dan pesimo servicio etc, son monumentos a la corrupcion."

4513,"Como que no, mire no mas nuestro propio país, no contemos 2020 por la pandemia, pero en el 2019 cuantas multinacionales se fueron? Phillip Morris, Mars, krispy creme, etc, lo mismo los dueños de negocios nacionales, cierra y se van a vivir a Estados Unidos, Canadá, Europa, etc y eso son las grandes empresas, ahora dañar negocios pequeños que talvez no tengan chance de recuperación? De nuevo protestar esta bien, vandalismo no."
4514,"Pues ese hecho en particular no. Pero ese hecho no es un sintoma, es una consecuencia. La gente está harta de andar en esos sistemas BRT caros, contaminantes, corruptos etc. Entonces quemarlos es simbolico. Para eso sirve. Como han servido todas las manifestaciones ciudadanas violentas. O usted cree que en algun país las cosas cambiaron con besatones y chocolatones? Encima en colombia las cosas se arreglan así. Las elites nos arreglan asi, con ejercitos legales, ilegales y burocraticos. Es el momento de hacernos sentir. Me da un poco de cagada con J pantano pero que coman mierda los dueños de esos buses en serio."
4515,Aja. Y cuántos bancos se han ido de Colombia?
4516,"No soy de Colombia pero estoy muy interesado en esto.  ¿Alguien sabe de un sitio donde pueda seguir este tema, la política colombiana y tal?

muy interesado en escuchar el resultado de esta protesta."
4517,"Tienes razon con esto fijo van a ""nesecitar"" mas fondos para reparar todo. Y luego hay que ver como se van a dispara los casos y se llenan las ucis, para luego verlos peleando por lo de la sanidad. Que círculo visioso mas hijueputa."
4518,"Este post es la perfecta muestra de que en Colombia no va a cambiar nada, mucho menos por la que quizá sea la única via posible: las protestas.

Aquí la gente se comió el cuento de que la protesta debe ser súper pacífica, serena, calladita, por el andén, pidan permiso, sólo pueden protestar de X a Y hora y no hagan mucho ruido porque qué molestia. Hasta salen a hacer rídculos como bailecitos, cantar canciones y llenar la protesta de memes porque ""hombre, es que esas no son maneras"".

Es que, en serio, imaginate a Duque y Carrasquilla súper preocupadisimos porque salieron a hacer una marchita por el andén y llegaron a un parque a hacer sancocho. ¡QUE SUSTO TAN TENAZ DE POR DIOS! Yo no sé cómo es que los franceses lograron los [acuerdos de Grenelle en el 68](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp-VXKQuQig) casi que acabando con París, cuando acá tenemos la mejor fórmula: Besatones, chocolatadas y ""no me tumbe el poste hermano, que esas no son formas""

Definitivamente, no hay ser más subdesarrollado, perdidamente cobarde e incorregiblemente sumiso que un Colombiano.  


>Si tanto estudian, actúen con inteligencia, tumbar un poste lo hace cualquier gamín

Ay por dios..."
4519,"Es un mal necesario para llamar la atención del ejecutivo y producir cambios. Una protesta sin tensión social es totalmente ignorada. Cuantas marchas no hemos tenido sin cambios? Cuantas veces no se ha marchado en Colombia y simplemente las cosas no cambian?

Es cierto que destruir bienes públicos es falto de toda logica. Pero recuerde que gran parte de los activos del estado y de los bancos estan asegurados por pólizas que cubren estos riesgos. No digo que por eso sea inteligente destruir todo (las primas de los seguros aumentan a mayor el riesgo) pero no es tampoco cierto que al pobre gobierno le toque quebrarse para pagar eso."
4520,"El país no evolucionará hasta que ""los buenos"" no hagan lo propio. No puede ser que sigan con los mismos métodos violentos de hace 30 años para manifestar desacuerdo con un gobierno tan débil como el de Duque"
4521,"Digale eso a los ñeros y a los locos de la calle,me dejaron con las ventanas rotas y las rejas todas dañadas solo porque la policia llego a un supermercado que estaban saqueando y se empezaron a pedrear, y si asi esta cali no me imagino por otros lados, y casi se me meten a la casa por defenderme y me pedrearon el cuarto de mis hermanas, sinceramente ya no le veo esperanza de mejora a colombia y pienso mudarme de aqui lo mas pronto posible antes de que me pase algo peor."
4522,"Usted de que habla de la plata que nos cuesta la protesta cuando nos van a clavar la tributaria a punta de billones ahi esta lo grave. Hablando de centavos cuando nos sacan millones por atras, prioridades porfavor."
4523,DÍA DE BRUTOS !
4524,"Pues mira, la pandemia ha sido devastadora con los más pobres. En este momento de crisis económica, las fotos multas no han bajado de precio. No hay ayudas del gobiernos. Los pequeños negocios quebrados o apenas sobreviviendo.
La gente aquí está MAMADA de la mala gestión del gobierno, de ver cómo los políticos se roban la ata de frente mientras las personas que viven al día de vender cosas en los semáforos o en las calles aguantan hambre por los toques de queda.
Es natural que la rabia general estalle. Antes de juzgar este tipo de cosas, te invito a ver qué tan privilegiado estás, para juzgar a quienes están sobreviviendo son migajas diarias"
4525,"Si les interesa tanto el dinero, tengan en cuenta que destruyendo la ciudad al menos toca meter plata para algo real, en vez de que se los roben.

4536,"Total. Un poste de esos cuesta 50 mil pesos en material, pero “es que nos los van a cobrar en los impuestos” mientras están marchando para que eso no pase. Pero se cayó el puente Chirajara en la vía al Llano, 3 billones de pesos y creo que como 15 muertos, pero es que esas no son formas.

Ellos nos roban, dan la orden que disparen y gaseen... pero esas no son formas.

No hay mayores acomodados que los antiuribistas rolos que creen que con besatones se gana algo mientras en otras partes del país matan a orden de nuestros honorables parlamentarios.

Le tienen mas miedo a ser “gamines” que a ser robados, esclavizados y humillados por toda vida.

Irónicamente tontos. No le echan cinco minutos de cabeza a la vaina."
4537,"Sigan destruyendo, la única opción!"
4538,Oigan a este erudito diciendo que el gobierno de duque es débil?? En USA pasa lo mismo entonces ellos tampoco han evolucionado ??? LA GENTE SE CANSO Y LA FOTO MULTA ES UNA FORMA DE QUITARLE DINERO AL PUEBLO DE FORMA INJUSTA.

Para, paraco etc, paramilitares : inicio como protección de las guerrillas cuando para lucrarse secuestraban, desplazaban forzosamente gente, extorsionaban y demas. Se corrompió tambien en grupos al margen de la ley con animo de lucro que emplean las mismas estrategias de lucro. Narcotrafico, secuestros, extorsiones, etc. (Estan del lado del ejército asi el ejercicio no lo diga públicamente.
Carrusel: corrupción
Mermelada: corrupción
Tamales: compra de votos que comunmente es por un tamal o 50 000 COP. 
Falsos positivos: practica de terrorismo sistemático estatal de masacrar inocentes y hacerlos pasar por guerrilleros muertos por el ejercicio. A cambio de dinero, ascenso s y hasta viajes.

4556,"Asista bajo su propio riesgo, si finalmente va a asistir, lleve un morral con agua, mascarillas adicionales, alcohol en gel y pañitos húmedos, una gorra, use zapatos cómodos. No lleve billetera, solo vaya con un documento de identidad y solo dinero en efectivo. Tampoco lleve celular de alta gama, las situaciones se salen muy fácil de control y si puede ir acompañado y avisando a algún familiar o amigo en que parte se encuentra y establezca un sitio de recogida en caso que la situación no de más.

Si la situación se sale de control, retírese del lugar, en las manifestaciones violentas los que pagan el ""pato"" son los menos experimentados o los curiosos."

4558,"Edit: Lo siento, creí que buscabas ""tips"" y consejos xd. En cualquier caso dejo el comentario por si a alguien le sirve.

Definitivamente lleva agua con bicarbonato de sodio, es un muy buen neutralizante para el gas lacrimógeno que tiran fuera de las universidades (dentro de estas tiran uno muchísimo más fuerte y el bicarbonato casi no sirve). Comprate uno o dos sobrecitos y revuelvelos en una botella de agua; si te empieza a picar la nariz/ojos, aplica en la cara y eso te va a aliviar bastante. Si ves a alguien que está sufriendo por el gas, ofrecele neutralizante, enserio que andar por ahí con esa mierda es muy fastidioso, y les va a salvar de pasar un rato malo. NO apliques agua potable en la cara, solo empeora la picazón.

Si planeas grabar casos de abuso policial o similares, NO uses desbloqueo biométrico (huella o facial) de celular, sino una contraseña, así no lo van a poder desbloqueae facilmente y eliminar la evidencia. Si quieres grabar capuchos o gente así, evita grabarles la cara, ya que suelen ser algo pesados con eso.

Ten cuidado con el celular, muchos malandros aprovechan la acumulación de personas para ver que se pueden robar de los bolsillos de otros. 

De ser posible, lleva una pila extra, o esas pilas portables, o al menos un cargador; estar incomunicado con tus amigos/conocidos/familiares cuando todo se pone denso es una situación que debes evitar.

Lleva líquido para hidratarte, las caminatas suelen ser largas :'v

Lleva sombrilla. A veces hace muuucho sol o se pone a llover, y esta ayuda bastante. Definitivamenre vale la pena la molestia de tener que cargarla.

Si estás en Bogotá, lleva la tarjeta del SITP, así sin importar a donde termines dando a parar, cuando ya te vayas a retirar y volver a tu casita, vas a poder hacerlo con facilidad (el mapa del celular o preguntarle a personas que atienden negocios también ayuda).

En caso de que la cosa se llegue a poner muy muy turbia y estés muy en medio del caos, no te asustes por las aturdidoras y empieces a correr a lo loco a atropellar a todo el mundo, estas no hacen realmente nada, solo es el ruido. Respecto a los granadas de gas, los del ESMAD inicialmente las tiran como ""rodando"" por el piso, y luego las tiran en forma de tiro parabolico, asi que mira hacia arriba y evita que te golpee una de estas (un casco también puede ayudar). Mucho cuidado con tu cabeza, si una de estas cosas te golpea en la cabeza, va a ocacionar muchisimo daño, llegando a incluso ser letal. NO las patees ni las cogas con la mano, suelen estar *muy* calientes, y patearlas solo es buscar hacerle daño a alguien más que está corriendo por ahí.

Del resto te diría que te calmes un poco, no es tan malo como uno cree o ve por ahí. En realidad el 95% del tiempo es casi como una ""fiesta"" en cierto sentido cultural. Cuando se pone denso, si estás lejos del epicentro (>100m), lo peor que vas a pasar es la molestia del gas, cosa que el agua con bicarbonato quita. En cualquier caso, trata de estar atento de tu alrededor, ya que los policias a veces tratan de acorralar a las personas asi no hagan nada malo.

Por último, enserio lleva agua con bicarbonato.

Cualquier duda me avisas"

¿No hay más vídeos?"
4563,Esos son los dueños del negocio
4564,"No son comerciantes, te doy el enlace, es de un En Vivo de facebook, lo puedes ver desde 1:30:00
https://www.facebook.com/304832806632353/videos/1179921202478405

En todo caso, por ese sector ya no habían protestas, incluso presencia de la policía en motos y tanqueta, no hay calles bloqueadas. Este era un grupo de periodistas que están de regreso y desde una calle contraria estaban estos señores disparando en contra de las pocas personas que ya iban de regreso. No es el único caso hoy en Medellín, hace pocos minutos llego una alerta de policías armando civiles en cercanías de el parque de los deseos y denuncias de casos en los que están forzando a las personas detenidas a dar testimonio en su contra, obligándolos a decir que están cometiendo actos vandálicos en la ciudad. En general, hoy a sido el día de mas violencia en el marco del paro nacional, han habido más muertos y heridos que en días anteriores."
4565,">no hay calles bloqueadas.

Yo veo muchas calles bloqueadas, con basura, fuego y escombros:

- 1:09:10
- 1:10:16
- 1:11:26

Y eso pues en lo poco que se alcanza a ver porque el tipo del facebook live debe ser miembro honorario de /r/killthecameraman, no hacía sino filmar el piso.

>No son comerciantes

Ha habido vandalismo, como el video evidencia. Ese es un banco completamente en llamas al minuto 1:17:51. No me parece descabellado pensar que civiles se pongan agresivos defendiendo sus barrios o negocios."
4566,"Deja de regar desinformación. Esta gente está de noche en un barrio que no es de ellos y se ve que los vándalos ya han quemado bastante propiedad privada. Tiene sentido que la gente no quiera a nadie ahí cerca. Puede que ellos en específico sean inocentes pero por las cagadas de algunas ratas que hacen vandalismo, los propietarios de negocios y la gente que vive  ahí no quiere a nadie en ese barrio. Tiene sentido, ¿Quién quiere que le dañen su fuente de trabajo o de vivienda?

¿Usted quiere que eso cambie? A bueno, entonces también denuncie a las ratas que hacen el vandalismo. Así, van a dejar a la gente que hace protestas pacíficas actuar. 

Pero si seguimos permitiendo a los vándalos actuar, no nos van a dejar protestar pacíficamente por una causa justa."
4567,"Felicitaciones, muy buen análisis del vídeo completo, pero, en el momento y lugar cuando son atacados los periodistas, ve usted disturbios? Ve calles bloqueadas? Ve que los que graban atenten contra alguien, que pueda provocar una reacción así? Justifica usted entonces, que otras personas anden por las calles disparando a lo que se atraviese en su camino? Creo que no dije que durante el día no hayan existido actos vandálicos ni nada parecido, me refiero por tanto, a que unas personas son atacadas en presencia de la policía por parte de civiles armados. Dije algo incorrecto?"
4568,"Deja de criticar sin tener un contexto. Si usted se tomara la molestia de ver el video completo, del cual publique el enlace en un comentario anterior, se daría cuenta que los que están grabando, no son manifestantes, ni atacaron algo o alguien. Están documentando lo que pasa de parte y parte. Pero claro! Es tan fácil lanzar juicios desde la comodidad de una pantalla. Vea el vídeo y desmienta lo que digo. LOS QUE GRABAN EL VIDEO, SON PERIODISTAS, creo que en ningún momento dije algo diferente a eso, o si?"
4569,"Ahh otra pregunta, es que acaso hay horarios establecidos para estar en determinados lugares? Es decir, yo no puedo ir a otro barrio en la noche, porque eso justifica que otra persona me ataque, solo por sospecha?"
4570,"Jamás dije que los que filmaban eran manifestantes. ¿Tal vez no sabes leer bien?

Si dije que es de sentido común que si han habido vándalos (cosas muy distintas) ahí en esa área haciendo daños (vi secciones del vídeo y hay lugares prendidos en fuego), la gente que vive o trabaja ahí no quiere que nadie se acerque a esa área.

Ellos no saben quién es quién en estos momentos y si hay alguien que no te quiere cerca a sus negocios debes respetar eso, ya hay mucha gente disfrazada de manifestante o periodista que ha resultado ser un criminal."
4571,"Usted no sabe con qué tipo de gente esos propietarios tuvieron que lidiar anteriormente. Usted y yo no tenemos contexto suficiente de esto. La gente tiene que aprender a respetar los espacios. 

En la noche obviamente que la gente tiene la guardia más alta puesto que ahí es cuando los malandros aprovechan para robar y vandalizar. Si estás en un barrio ajeno de noche te expones a esto."

La reforma afecta más a la clase media, y aún así la expansión de la base tributaria solo afecta al 10% con mayores ingresos en el país, si algo solo opino que debería ser todavía mayor el incremento a los impuestos al 1%, que aunque hubo incremento no me pareció suficiente."

La Whipala (al menos en Argentina, Bolivia, Chile y Perú) es usada para representar a los pueblos andinos (principalmente a los aymaras y quechuas), por lo que el resto de pueblos indígenas no se identifica con esa bandera."
4607,Let me guess: you would prefer if everyone stayed locked indoors indefinitely.
4608,"También tenia entendido eso, y es justamente esa la razón por la que me hace tanto ruido que la usen porque los pueblos andinos del tawantinsuyo como los que mencionas son  ultraminoritarios en nuestro pais y no tiene mucho sentido usar sus simbolos (tengo entendido que apenas tienen población en nariño y poco mas), además de que otros pueblos como los wayuu y los misak que están mas presentes también tienen sus banderas pero hasta ahora no he visto que las usen en protestas."
4609,"Yo hablaba más a nivel continental que su uso no está extendido, sino a nivel regional.

Yo creo que la razón por la que se ve a gente usando esa bandera es más que nada por ser la más popular. Al menos yo como extranjero no conozco nada de los pueblos indígenas de Colombia, y dado las imágenes que he visto en varios portales sobre el ambiente político del país me da la impresión de que su peso no es el mismo que en los otros países que mencioné."

Si el objetivo es clari y preciso y va dirigdo a una accione n particular, estoy seguro que el tipo terminaria renunciando, asi como paso con la reforma tributaria y la renuncia de Carrasquilla. Pero sin tener un objetivo claro......el problema siempre seguira igual"

Hacer bloqueos, suben los precios de los alimentos y los pobres no los pueden pagar;

4711,"Customer service is not a focus of most businesses here. The excuse is typically cost related, but with limited competition, it's just not a motivating factor. The hassle to open an account at a different bank, plus the restrictions on new accounts, makes existing customers stay. And it's not like the next bank will be any better. Same goes for telecom. Three real providers here, so as long as one isn't significantly worse than the others, none will lose a large number of customers. 

The general Colombian market is heavily focused on price point. I have taught my girlfriend to look at price per gram or price per unit in the grocery store. She's shocked every time she finds a product she used to buy because the total price is lower, but the price per gram/unit is higher than a similar product of a larger pack size. In turn, she's also found that buying a higher quality product (beans for example) results in less waste from throwing out damaged product, plus time saved, so sometimes it's worth it to buy higher quality.

It frustrated me when I first came here, but I have a vehicle, so I've found the locations that have less of a line/wait. For ATM's, I've found the grocery stores with one connected tend to not have a line. I don't have a cédula yet, so entering a bank isn't a problem yet. For cell services, see if you're provider allows you to schedule an appointment online. At least that way you skip the line outside.

In my opinion, the issues in Colombia are nothing compared to the beauty, people and culture. I came from a very far paced, high stress life in the US, and I've decided to let it go and live on ""island time"". It's worked out well so far."
4712,"La burocracia colombiana puede ser muy frustrate. Siempre que voy al banco tengo que armarme de paciencia. Toma muchísimo tiempo y la gente no siempre quiere ayudar. Un servicio terrible, como dices tú.

Si necesitas sacar plata, en algunos supermercados te dejan hacerlo en la caja. A veces es más fácil y práctico."
4713,"If you just wanna take money out with a US debit card, look for Servibanca. There are almost never any lines there, and they let you take out up to a million at a time if you need it."
4714,"Thanks for the detailed response.  I understand that you can't really switch companies to get better service because of lack of choice unfortunately.  But I'm legitimately curious how people hold down a job when these services demand so much time and are only open during the work day. Colombian employers don't seem extra generous with benefits/pay from what I've heard.  Making an appointment doesn't seem like a common option here. Just wondering how people could move apartments or buy a house or something that would require interacting with multiple services without taking a week off of work. 

&#x200B;

I agree that there are many benefits to living here that outweigh this one negative, just was curious about it.  I do appreciate not everyone here being overly concerned about time and efficiency, the US lifestyle is not very empathetic or forgiving and stresses me out too."
4715,"They ask for time off and don't get paid for it. We give up to a half day off without reducing pay for personal issues, but that isn't common. Some employers, especially in agriculture, are absolute tyrants. Many people will have a family member handle it for them. If you think it's bad in the cities, imagine living in a rural community, and having a half day walk, or bus ride that costs about 15% of a days pay to even get to where the service you need is offered."

4736,"Jumm con la popularidad de los políticos y el congreso por los suelos, menos mal a ninguno militar se le ha dado por hacer un golpe de estado"
4737,Pues se veia venir. Yo en cali tengo amigos que eran petristas y ahora quieren votar por la cabal .\_. porque su ciudad se volvio un desastre lol. Lo del paro se extendio demasiado. Creo que el descontrol con alguno de los que protestaban les paso factura. Aunque duque tambien de cierta forma destruyo su partido.
4738,"Me parece que la política de no negociar  por parte del gobierno ha cumplido su propósito, echar por tierra las buenas intenciones de la protesta, si a ello se le suma un comité de paro que no representa a nadie y un montón de revueltas que solo trasmiten desorden y  dejan vandalismo,  podemos decir que estamos igual que al principio o peor. Sí fuera necesario decir quién ganó y quien perdió, tal vez diría que ganó el gobierno, porque la popularidad de sus detractores está por el piso, sin seder mayor cosa, perdió la protesta porque no consigo mayor cosa, y sí dejo múltiples daños que afectan al pueblo, otro perdedor,  mismo que ahora aborrece la protesta esa misma de la que podría mayor beneficio."
4739,"The results are interesting to follow over time. I think the margin of error for cities outside Bogotá is a bit high at around +-7% for a 95% interval of confidence (it reached almost 10% for the May 18-22 poll). Also, I've always thought they give too much weight to landline polling compared to cellphone polling (almost 2 to 1, a bit less in Bogotá which perhaps may explain the slightly lower margin of error). They explain that they do random simple selection of respondents within homes - the ones who pick up the calls. Now, what are the kind of people that are there to pick a landline call to answer a survey during the day? I believe there is a hidden skew here to consider. 

Putting that aside, I think that people in general right now are disgusted with politics and politians overall. How will that play out during next year's elections? It's too early too know. Nobody came out unscathed of the protests: Claudia López, Fajardo, Peñalosa, Uribe, Duque, the government-dominated Congress and the rest of government institutions. 

What's important in these surveys is to identify tendencies, most rebounds are well within the margins of error. For instance, you can see in the graphic clear waning of Uribe's favorable image over time. That in itself is significant but paired with the idea that people are not willing to sacrifice their freedoms for more security, a historic gap in recent disfavorability/unvorability of the police forces, and an increase in the unfavorability of the armed forces, it seems to me that the Seguridad Democrática doctrine might be slowly dying and that is good for Colombia in the long run, regardless what the election results might be in the short-run. 

Duque's approval/disapproval gap is still abismal. It caught my attention that La Silla Vacía's analysis on his numbers is misleading:

>Después de ese 18 por ciento, al que llegó antes del paro, con el debate de la tributaria, el presidente vuelve a tener el favor de casi un tercio de los encuestados. 

23% approval rate is not even a fourth of the interviewees, much less a third. There's no need to hype him like this. What La Silla Vacía didn't say is that 84% of Colombians believe that things are getting worse - 3% more than in May - which was the toughest month of the strike. Just 10% of the people think that the country is going well and this falls mainly upon the shoulders of the government. I have no doubts that the actions of the government-controlled Congress - whose favorability is in lows not seen since 1994 - affects its overall image, and Fiscalía, Procuraduría, Contraloría and Corte Suprema de Justicia all show worse favorability numbers.

The strike was never going to reach significant reforms of any kind - because of protests' devaluation as a mechanism to achieve true political change and this goverment's own willingness to rectify its course due to popular demand - but it certainly shook things up. It will be fun to see what happens in the months to come."
4740,Donde hicieron esa encuesta en el chico? o en los rosales?
4741,"Esos no es que estén muy bien de popularidad... Además, con gobierno demócrata en El Norte, no hay chance (afortunadamente)."
4742,"Ojalá lo dieran. La única manera de salvar a Colombia es reconstruyendo desde las cenizas. Las instituciones democráticas están corruptas desde la raíz, cortar las ramas no cambiará nada."
4743,"Si, hay algo que muchos no han entendido, si bien Duque es impopular no lo es por falta de medidas zurdas, sino por falta de medidas conservadoras (que fue el sector que lo eligió) en esa medida el será cada vez mas  impopular pero en pro de quien se presente mas conservador y con un discurso que apele mas a la seguridad y el orden.

Muchas personas quieren evitar el desorden de la izquierda y ven a Duque exageradamente blando, lo que afecta su imagen, pero no por las razones que la gente de izquierda creen.

La mayoría de la gente del común solo quiere un poco de mano dura para que sus vidas y sus trabajos vuelvan a la normalidad sin afectaciones.

En tanto se sigan dando estos exabruptos, si bien Duque seguiría mermando, no sería para dar ventaja a la izquierda sino para dejar abierto el nicho a quien se presente con el discurso mas centrado desde el punto de vista conservador.

Muchos celebraban que Colombia había ""despertado"" y no se dieron cuenta que lo que despertaron fue los conservadores que ya se estaban empezando a ir a dormir.

Ahora mismo cada bobada que cometa o Duque o el Alcalde de Calí o el alcalde zurdo de cualquier ciudad importante solo va mejorar la imagen de Cabal y ya quiero ver las estadísticas nuevas de los precandidatos van a estar muy divertidas ya que si bien Petro se presentaba fuerte antes del paro, el ""no sabe no responde"" y el ""voto en blanco"" siguen siendo mas fuertes en los últimos reportes, y creo que ese resultado se va empezar a distribuir hacia la nueva candidata conservadora.

Yo en lo personal que NUNCA he votado a ningún candidato del uribismo, NUNCA, tengo claro en este momento que si la segunda vuelta se da entre Petro y Cabal, me veré en la incomoda necesidad de votar por Cabal ya que me quedó claro que a Petro le interesan estos exabruptos y no le importa el desabastecimiento.

Muy dificil que yo vuelva a votar por Petro nunca mas en la vida."
4744,"La popularidad del gobierno también está por el piso, en este mismo artículo lo expresan:

""Duque mejora poco por encima del margen de error de la encuesta, después de haber llegado a los peores índices de desfavorabilidad de un presidente desde que se empezó la medición, en el gobierno de Andrés Pastrana. """

Y como se explica entonces la creciente impopularidad de Uribe, quien siempre ha sido representante de la ""mano dura""?"
4753,"Sí, pero su interés primordial al no negociar es cuidar la imagen del partido frente a las próximas elecciones."
4754,"Parcero, usted tiene un trauma muy grande con Petro, ¿ha ido al psicólogo? Porque veo que lo preda hasta en el caldo del desayuno."
4755,"Yo creo que si Fajardo llega a segunda vuelta podría ganar, o alguien como el, yo votaría por el, de lo contrario ya decidí que votaré lo mas a la derecha que haya, asi me toque votar por Cabal."
4756,"Vamos a ver Uribe es una figura muy personalista. En algún momento dejará de ser un mesias, eso no significa que la gente vaya a dejar de ser conservadora. Hasta Churchill envejeció mal en su segundo mandato y fue bastante impopular.

La crisis de liderazgo se va resolver con liderazgo. A Uribe la izquierda lo suele sobredimensionar, cuando el solo representó la amalgama de todos los sectores politicos algunos dispares entre si en un momento de terrorismo sin precedentes, sin duda en la actualidad la situación está lejisimos de lo que era en el momento en que Uribe era una gran opción, pero no significa que ante el desorden producido por la izquierda el trabajador no vaya a desear orden..

Uribe no es una teoría económica o social, y su movimiento tampoco es un partido de algún purismo ideológico, tanto es así que hasta tienen ex guerrilleros en sus filas. Hay una nueva generación, gente que ni siquiera vivió el gobierno de Uribe que no por ello hoy tienen que ser personas de ""izquierda"", ""derecha"" o conservadores.

Uribe llegó a la presidencia después de 2 políticos bastante diferentes de el y Samper y Pastrana, Pastrana que era bastante parecido a Duque y Samper que era un zurdo de cabo a rabo, en ese momento la gente se cansó del desorden y el terrorismo y renuncó a las singularidades politicas en pro de un ""guerrero"" que trajera el triunfo.

Hoy en día no tenemos carros bomba o pescas milagrosas, Uribe ha envejecido, pero el desorden exige un poco de mano dura aunque esta mano dura no tenga la misma intensidad que en el 2000, pues hay que recordar que en el 2000 ir por la calle representaba un terrible peligro de morir en un atentado terrorista facilmente (a mi me tocarón como 3 o 4 ataques terroristas en diferentes momentos de mi vida)

Hoy no se da ese peligro, asi que es aceptable que ya no se necesite un discurso tan extremo como el de Uribe, pero el orden sigue siendo prioritario, ya no se necesita un guerrero, pero se necesita firmeza."
4757,Esta es la clase de gente que cree que todos los problemas de Colombia son culpa de Petro.
4758,"Resulta que las hordas petristas pasan por mi apartamento todos los días, molestando mi tranquilidad, aumentando el expendio de drogas y el hurto en la zona.

3. No sé si Petro sea Cocainomano, cada quién su nariz, pero decir que el aumento de expendio de drogas es culpa de los manifestantes es error, obviamente es algo que, al igual que el covid, venía a la alza desde antes del paro.


4. Y si por consumo de ""drogas"" se refiere a la Mariguana, pos, ahí sí se puede ser menos objetivo. Yo, en lo personal, no lo considero una droga como tal. Pero pues, cada quién su pensar respecto a eso.

Lo que se ha visto, por las declaraciones que han salido en la prensa y en las redes sociales, es que hay muchas y muy distintas razones por las que los manifestantes se hn movilizado en Colombia , pues así está ocurriendo en el mundo entero, donde las ciudadanías se quejan de que los politicos no atienden las necesidades de las mayorías, sino las de las élites. Aquí tenemos un gobierno favoreciendo principalmente a la élite de su partido; ni siquiera gobierna a favor de todos los que votaron por el candidato de ese partido, ni para la oposición (lo que aqui se tiene como lógico) ni mucho menos lo hace para favorecer a los que no votaron. Se aprovechan y hace caso omiso a que Duque es el presidente de todos los colombianos y eso es lo que sacó a la gente a las calles. Es absurdo pensar que Petro tiene tal capacidad de movilización, aunque con el tiempo están llevando a esos jóvenes que no tienen posición política definida a unirse a Petro porque ven que sabido interpretar sus motivaciones y necesidades."
4778,"Y quien mierda los puso de lideres del paro?
Hasta donde se, el paro es apolitico."
4779,"El glifosato o los productos que lo contienen son cancerígenos. 

Varios estudios científicos independientes (es decir, no financiados por Monsanto-Bayer u otras empresas agroalimentarias) han confirmado que el glifosato no sólo es peligroso para el medio ambiente, sino también para la salud humana.

Así que lo que me has mostrado es pura propaganda.

Además, me gustaría añadir que la deforestación no sólo está causada por el cultivo de coca; la deforestación también puede estar causada por el cultivo de soja y otros productos básicos."
4780,"No, el paro no es apolítico. No puede serlo cuando aquello que motiva el paro es consecuencia directa de las políticas que han regido hasta ahora. El paro es una expresión de inconformismo político. Algunos de esos líderes son los jefes de cada sindicato. Quienes no nos vemos representantafos en ellos debemos construir mecanismos de representación o diálogo, también."
4781,"Esa es una excelente pregunta, esos manes son sindicalistas hace años, y viven del paro, mientras unos pasan hambre y se matan con la policia ellos ganan plata 🤷‍♀️"
4782,"está todo indexado como para hablar de propaganda, además la deforestación acá es por coca, minería ilegal y en menor medida ganaderos o sembradores de palma, acá no hay plantaciones de soya (al menos del nivel de argentina o brasil)."
4783,"El tema es que el sindicato solo busca beneficio propio y las personas que buscan realmente el beneficio colectivo, han perdido el rumbo, es más se perdió el rumbo directamente de su origen, ""unión de ciudadanos para la defensa de los derechos civiles"".

Se volvio un tema de palanca, que un tema de unión ciudadana desde para ser veedores de los procesos públicos y vulneración de derechos.

Son visto como políticos, no como la representación de la clase obrera o popular del país, estoy seguro que muchas personas que están en el sindicato, son personas que realmente abogan por lo que la gente necesita, pero hay mucha gente, sobretodo los de arriba, que representan el egoísmo humano y de este país.

Ojala en Colombia se observaran las uniones laborales que se ven en Alemania o en Europa."
4784,"La verdad es que la fuente que usted subio es muy poco seria, a diferencia de la respuesta que le dieron, muy bien sustentada con ciencia.

A fin de cuentas la coca son 200,000 hectareas maximo. Cuántas hectareas se deforestan por ganaderia en el país si estamos hablando de al menos 50 millones de cabezas de ganado?"
4785,"La puse porque precisamente porque tiene una serie de links que redireccionan a las páginas donde están los estudios que están indexadas en lugares serios, si quiere mañana me pongo y le copio y le pego cada link (que era lo que quería evitar poniendo el link inicial).

Si son más o son menos no viene al comentario inicial en el que decía que el glifosato me parece menos perjudicial que esperar a que sigan deforestando; obvio es un problema la ganadería, el cultivo de palma entre otras cosas como lo mencione también pero ese no era el tema."
4786,"Siempre he sostenido que en Colombia la gente no sabe de protestas, estamos acostumbrados a agachar la cabeza. La protesta se hace por un corto tiempo y luego quiere que la dejen trabajar, aunque este sufriendo fuentes necesidades. A eso juega el gobierno a que la misma gente, por agotamiento deslegitime la protesta, y pase de ser el verdugo al salvador que restableció el orden  Tal vez en momento determinado se reavive, pero si el colombiano de a pie no entiende que están son cosas de largo aliento y de fuerte inversión no conseguirá nada y seguimos en la situación que estamos. Mi única esperanza es que está situación le pase factura en las urnas a la clase política que nos tiene en las que estamos."
4787,"La pregunta del millón es: Que legitimidad, quien representan los líderes del paro que están a la mesa de negociación.
Sin legitimidad popular no pueden llegar a nada. Duque hace ""damage control"" y no va a negociar nada con gente que no representan a nadie mas que ellos mismos. 
Los que manifestaron contra la reforma tributaria, el verdadero pueblo colombiano no afiliado, hace rato regresó a casa."
4788,"Creo que se lograron muchas cosas que era imposible que sucedieran con este gobierno tan descarado:

1. Replantamiento de la reforma tributaria. Se sabe que el texto original genera descontento social así que les toca pensar bien el nuevo texto que todo el mundo va a estar encima vigilando.
2. Renunció el ministro de hacienda, el viceministro general de hacienda, el alto comisionado para la paz.
3. Matrícula gratuita en el semestre 2021-2 para estratos 1 a 3 (no es mucho pero es algo).
4. Reforma  a la estructura de la policía nacional, el ministerio de defensa, y la estupidez del cambio de color de uniformes y patrullas.
5. La concientización de mucha gente respecto a la necesidad de la educación y vigilancia de la fuerza pública en derechos humanos, que antes no era tema de conversación.
6. El desanmascaramiento del gobierno actual a nivel local e internacional como represor y violador de derechos humanos.
7. Más del 70% de los colombianos apoyó en cierta medida el paro (Mobimetrics), lo que evidencia el despertar social y político de las mayorías, y se naturaliza el exigir al gobierno cumplir un estándar mayor.
8. El fortalecimiento de los grupos políticos de oposición, dada su evidente influencia, que a su vez motivó a poderosos sectores empresariales a preguntarse si apoyar la campaña de los de siempre era necesario.
9. El retiro de algunas armas exesivas en el ESMAD.

Obviamente seguirá la mamadera de gallo, toca esperar hasta las próximas elecciones, quizá el descontento social se sienta en las urnas también, esperaría uno la reducción del ausentismo."
4789,"La verdad no lo veo como fracaso porque no nos dejamos meter las reformas. Carrasquilla renunció y la comunidad internacional se enteró cómo son realmente los que nos gobiernan. Nuestra situación es muy compleja y no podemos pretender cambiar todo en un par de semanas, eso es imposible!  Tenemos que seguir día a día integrando los cambios que queremos ver en nuestra cotidianidad eliminando lo que tanto criticamos en nuestros políticos. Por ejemplo, si estamos cansados de la corrupción, entonces dejemos de sobornar a policías o agentes de tránsito para evitar multas. Si queremos fortalecer nuestra economía, entonces apoyemos a los campesinos y emprendimientos locales. Hay que dejar de vender el voto por un tamal o peor aún, seguir en abstinencia electoral. Hay que dejar de ver los canales que desinforman y manipulan. Hay que revisar cómo sembramos violencia desde nuestras propias acciones y tratar de cambiar eso. Lo que vemos afuera no es más que un  eco de lo que nosotros hacemos."
4790,[removed]
4791,"No consideró que fracasó, todavía hay manifestaciones en varias ciudades, hay encuentros ciudadanos y otras maneras de resistir. No fracasó, la gente se está organizando, se reconoce que la acción de salir a la calle no es suficiente, se están haciendo asambleas, se están creando organizaciones, hay más espacios de diálogo y de educación, hay más voluntad política de la gente, de conocer cómo puedo yo aportar,  qué mecanismos de participación existe, la política no es solo salir a votar y esperar  que los otros hagan, necesitamos que nos involucremos, en el territorio donde habitemos, que seguramente hay muchas problemáticas, bueno desde ahí, empezar, cómo hago una veeduría, cómo hacer una auditoría, qué contratos  se están haciendo, qué políticos no han pasado proyectos, esto es de largo aliento. Me siento muy orgullosa porque el paro sirvió para reconocer que somos muchos los que nos interesa hacia dónde va el país y nuestro futuro. Es el paro más largo qué he visto en mis años."
4792,"El fracaso más grande del paro fue que a sus impulsores Petro y demás líderes lo hicieron con fines políticos, pero ahora que por causa del paro están muriendo cientos de personas, petro tiene miedo que afecte sus aspiraciones electorales."
4793,"La falta de organizacion y exigencias poco realistas para lo que vive Colombia en el momento dan muestra del fracaso del Paro. Me parecio un atentado contra la juventud lo que ha hecho el tal ""comite del paro"" al apropiarse de las manifestaciones y sacar provecho politico con el dolor de los jovenes. Por otra parte, me duele en el corazon calificar a los de la primera linea como ""idiotas utiles,"" pues no fueron tomados en cuenta para las negociaciones, y ellos eran los que ponian la cara. Finalmente, esta forma de protestar, solo dio pie para que gobierno y otros grupos deslegitimizaran la protesta como mecanismo democratico, pues algo que debio ser un llamado a escuchar el pueblo, termino siendo recordado como bloqueos, exceso de fuerza y actos vandalicos.

Edit: como comentario final...Espero y aspiro que este descontento generalizado se vea reflejado en las elecciondes de congreso, senado y presidencia del 2022."
4794,"El paro falló porque al gobierno no le importa los derechos humanos. 

Cuando las mercancías se encuentran estancadas por razones de logística a causa de los paros y bloqueos viales, ese problema es de los ciudadanos causado por los ciudadanos.

El fallo ahí está en el hecho que el paro no afecta al gobierno si no al ciudadano, especialmente al ciudadano de bajos recursos que no representa ninguna amenaza social a la élite del país, o sea los ricos. El gobierno no se responsabiliza de nada, ni en el pasado ni ahora.

La comunidad internacional no se mete, los estados unidos nos meten plata en el bolsillo y la desgracia democrática continúa gracias al lavado de cerebro tan hijueputa que nos han hecho."
4795,"No la clase política no hace que se sienta frustrado eso uno lo hace solito,protestar protestar creo que debería uno protestar contra si mismo sus malas desiciones,su flojera,pero es más sencillo psicológicamente que otro tenga la culpa no yo,de lo que me pasa,Gente hay Covid cuídense y a sus familias, suben los casos por las aglutinamientos de gente de las protestas."
4796,"Totalmente de acuerdo,las reformas ya se callejón,me tomé la libertad de leer lo que pide el comité del paro,y están grande pide alrededor de 132 cosas,que tomarían 5 reformas tributarias para hacerlas,ya que el problema de fondo es que no hay plata."
4797,"No caigas en el mismo error que el gobierno.  Para el gobierno el paro no es legítimo ya y solo lo ve como producto de la intervención de Venezuela/Rusia 🙄 o el llamado electoral de Petro o gente pagada por los narcos, bacrim o guerrilla. Con esta justificación el gobierno hace oídos sordos y cierra la puerta al diálogo. Con esto el gobierno no ve qué los jóvenes que sigue en las calles lo hacen porque siguen teniendo peticiones legítimas. Los jóvenes quedan sin ser escuchados y esto genera más frustración.

El comité del paro no representa a todos los sectores. Eso es bien conocido e incluso lo han dicho ellos. Es responsabilidad del gobierno buscar canales de comunicación con los demás sectores, y si estos no tienen líderes claros, pues es también tarea del gobierno dar espacios y garantizar que estos liderazgos surjan. Por qué es responsabilidad del gobierno? Porque sencillamente para eso es la política."
4798,"Pese a que no estoy de acuerdo con muchos puntos del paro, debo reconocer que estos en particular si los veo como logros...solo espero que en serio la solucion que salga de todo esta sea lo mejor para el pais"
4799,"Tienes razon que se han logrado cosas compañero, pero el problema ahora sera ver que si se cumplan algunas de esas cosas que se han logrado o que el apoyo (o union nacional) se mantenga. Por poner un ejemplo de cosas que se dijeron para calmar los animos pero al final no se estan cumpliendo: la matricula cero para este 2021 al final se ha hundido en el congreso, asi que la promesa hecha por el gobierno con la cual tanto se ha dicho ""estamos escuchando al pueblo y ayudandolos en este tiempo de necesidad "" al final ha sido algo que han tumbado los mismos que son mas afines al gobierno en el congreso y con ello se ha demostrado que poca cosa se puede confiar en lo ganado (al menos frente a lo que ha "" cedido"" el gobierno central)."
4800,"Gracias en por tus palabras.

En mis 3 décadas de existencia realmente no me habían sentido tan lleno de desesperanza, frustración y decepción. No veo un futuro en este pais. He sido privilegiado, soy profesional de una de las universidades de mayor prestigio del país y desde que me gradué hace 10 años he tenido trabajo. Si yo me siento así, no me imagino el nivel de frustración y desesperanza de los jóvenes menos privilegiados.

Me quedo con lo que dices, nuestra situación es compleja y tomará tiempo mucho tiempo en llegar soluciones de fondo. Nuestra lucha consistirá entonces en asegurar que estemos en la senda correcta hacia el cambio"
4801,De acuerdo.
4802,Sobretodo le devolvieron la popularidad a Uribe jajajaja. Si algo le hizo el paro al CD y a Uribe es mostrar lo desconectados que están con el pueblo y con lo que quieren. No digo que fortaleció a la izquierda. Pero no crea que la reforma tributaria que el CD casi le mete al país le encantó a todo el mundo.
4803,based
4804,"No estoy de acuerdo contigo. El pobre no es pobre porque quiere. Mucha gente se esfuerza, estudia y trabaja de forma honrada. Pero a pesar de su esfuerzo nunca sale de pobre. La movilidad social del país es inexistente, se requieren 11 generaciones para salir de pobre. 

https://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias-45022393

Hay frustración porque a pesar del esfuerzo no hay avances y la clase política y la élite que ha gobernado el país no hace nada."
4805,"Imagínate la gente como yo... que a pesar de ser profesional graduada hace 10 años de Univalle no pude tener un empleo estable porque en mi profesión todo depende de la rosca. Como decidí que no iba a sembrar corrupción, he tenido que trabajar en lo que me saliera; desde logística en una pista de patinaje en un centro comercial hasta empleada doméstica de un extranjero (que es mi trabajo actual). Mi tiempo libre lo invierto en fortalecer mi emprendimiento y hago lo posible por hacerlo crecer. Aún así no voy a huir de mi país. Voy a seguir luchando para aportarle al cambio. Para que las generaciones venideras de científicos puedan tener empleos y verdaderas oportunidades laborales.  Voy a apostarle a sembrar un mejor país. No importa que no lo vea manifestado en lo que me queda de vida, vivo con la certeza de que nada es permanente."
4806,"A nadie le gustó, ese es mi punto.
Si hubiesen dejado de joder Justo después de que presidencia desistiera con la reforma ya nadie lo querría."
4807,"Una persona pobre,no estudia ya que el salirio de su familia es bajo y no alcanzaría a costearse los estudios universitarios,creo que a lo que te refieres de movilidad es a la clase media baja,la cual si estudia sea a base de préstamo, y sigue siendo clase baja, pero el mundo cambio y ahora no es necesario ir a la universidad para progresar puedes aprender a programar y certificarte gratis y trabajar muy bien,lo digo por experiencia,pero para eso hay que cambiar el paradigma mental,revelarse contra ese pensamiento de víctima,y tener fortaleza cognitiva,ahora más que nunca se necesitan personas que sepan de tecnología,éxitos y ojalá sepas que se puede todo es cuestión de misent y ahora con todo esto de la pandemia,cambiar de rubro."
4808,"Si parce, pero que a mucha gente no le haya parecido las formas del paro no significa que eso le dio popularidad a Uribe. Los que veo que se pueden beneficiar bastante si son Enrique Peñalosa, Fico y Char. No apoyaron el paro nunca pero tampoco apoyaron la reforma. Una gran sección de la población se va a sentir identificada con eso."
4809,"Te recomiendo este libro:

[https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Michael-J-Sandel-ebook/dp/B08BX9QJFX/ref=sr\_1\_3?\_\_mk\_es\_US=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=1YE800697NW8G&dchild=1&keywords=la+tirania+de+la+meritocracia&qid=1623804894&sprefix=la+tirania+de+la+meri%2Caps%2C224&sr=8-3](https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Michael-J-Sandel-ebook/dp/B08BX9QJFX/ref=sr_1_3?__mk_es_US=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=1YE800697NW8G&dchild=1&keywords=la+tirania+de+la+meritocracia&qid=1623804894&sprefix=la+tirania+de+la+meri%2Caps%2C224&sr=8-3)

Me parece super interesante porque critica el modelo de universidades y el credidencialismo que se ha creado alrededor del tema. Te aportaria perspectivas interesantes. La idea central del libro es que la meritocracia moderna crea ganadores arrogantes que creen que su posicion privilegiada es producto de su esfuerzo y perdedores humillados que creen que no sea han esforzado lo suficiente. Esta forma de pensar crea muchos problemas que son explicados en el libro. Por ejemplo hace que los ganadores sean menos solidarios o que el estado se meta en la vida de los perdedores para ver si se han esforzado lo suficiente y por lo tanto merecen un subsidio. En verdad es un muy buen libro. Te lo recomiendo, te dará nuevas perspectivas en que pensar.

Creo que estas juzgando las cosas mucho desde tu posicion y experiencia. Que bueno que hayas conseguido trabajo como programador. Efectivamente es una area que no requiere titulos, unicamente habilidades practicas. Pero no todos pueden ser programadores. Para ser programadores se requieren ciertas habilidades que no todo el mundo tiene por mas que estudien. Ademas, tampoco a todo el mundo le gusta. Que tu disfrutes pasar 6, 8 u 12 horas diarias frente a un PC no quiere decir que todo el mundo lo disfrute. Que pasará con las personas que no les gusta? Basado en tu experiencia, no puedes concluir simplemente que  solo es cuestion de esforzarse o cambiar el mindset. Es problema es mas complejo todavia, no lo simplifiques tanto!

Aqui un video que tambien podria aportarte otros puntos de vista

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ML6ABJqBU\_g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ML6ABJqBU_g)

El estudio que te envie sobre movilidad social en el pais con parametros objetivos de la economia nos permite concluir que realmente no existen las condiciones para que la gente salga de pobre o no retrocedan si lo llegan a hacer. Fijate que la conclusion de estos economistas no es que la gente no quiere salir de la pobreza."
4810,"Agree... aunque se me hace que despues de la tumbada de la reforma la de la salud habria sido mejor. Habrian quedado como *salvadores* y el pais se habria ido contra Duque por haber creado tal problema  lol. Esto al irse tan largo y tener tanta desorganizacion lo que ha hecho es que muchos colombianos se esten moviendo a la derecha o los grupos Paramilitares esten creciendo de nuevo. No controlar a muchos de los que hacen vandalismo le ha pasado su factura a los del paro tambien. Yo tengo un vecino que era full-petro  y apoyaba resto las marchas pero una vez vio que no le estaba llegando el surtido a su almacen ahora anda pensando en votar por otra opcion.   


Solo mi opinion.   


Yo solo espero que esto realmente sirva para llevar a Colombia a un mejor lugar. Todo pasa por una razon. Creo que estas marchas han permitido darse cuenta sobre muchas cosas en el pais."
4811,"Si el paro se hubiese desmovilizado en el momento en que se bajo la reforma, la reforma la volverian a subir meses despues, y ni el paro ni el cansancio sirvio de nada. Hay que ser un poco mas ambicioso."
4812,"Siempre me ha parecido que el pueblo colombiano no sabe de protesta, es más bien una sociedad acostumbrada a agachar la cabeza. A estas alturas ya no se va a conseguir nada, el gobierno no va a negociar, porque el paro y los bloqueos en si mismos le convienen, juega con el cansancio de la gente para sacar ventaja política, hace las veces de salvador de una situación que no le interesa arreglar. Las marchas y las protestas son un procedimiento que supone un costo y una inversión muy alta para lograr algo, no solo en Colombia, sino en cualquier parte del mundo, en cualquier lugar del mundo se presentan desmanes y se salen de curso ( estoy seguro que a ninguno nos gustan esas cosas) pero en algunas ocasiones sin algo de eso la sociedad no logra moverse, no pretendo hacer una justificación del vandalismo, pero aquí, antes de conseguir algo la sociedad ya quiere volver a normalidad porque se canso, por eso es una sociedad acostumbrada a agachar la cabeza.

En cuanto a los infiltrados en las protestas, ni  siquiera se puede descartar que que exista de los dos bandos, desde los extremistas que dañar y destrozar es el único camino para reclamar, hasta los que usan los mismos destrozos  para desacreditar la protesta social misma, pues en ese caso particular siempre es más fácil culpar al que sale a protestar.

En fin, no hará falta desde el que no quiera la protesta aunque tenga necesidades y motivos pero prefiero callarse y aguantarse, hasta el que no la quiere, simplemente porque ni leva ni le viene y como están las cosas le parece más conveniente para sus intereses, algo así como si no me afecta, no es mi problema."
4813,"Mi opinion: aunque la reforma como tal fue el detonante del estallido social no se puede tomar en cuenta como la única causa, los sectores vulnerables que son casi un 50% del país (hogares donde los hijos no pueden estudiar y deben elegir entre salir a vender dulces para apoyar a su familia o morir de hambre) actualmente no tienen nada que perder, ni vivienda digna, ni educación, ni salud, ni alimento, por eso eso se llegó a un punto donde no les importa morir, al final, con el abandono que han sufrido, con tantas noches yéndose a dormir acostado a los hijos con hambre, pues la muerte es el único gesto lindo que la vida tendría con ellos, por eso, no estoy a favor de que se levante la movilización hasta que estos grupos lo decidan, porque la movilización es de ellos, los que comemos 3 veces al día no deberíamos ni siquiera discutirlo


Hay otro problema y es que el gobierno no está interesado en hablar con esta población, por ese mismo motivo no se llega a ningún acuerdo con el comité de paro aunque este haya sido prácticamente armado por el gobierno, porque no les interesa, quieren que los pobres sigan bloqueando porque solo van a afectar a otros pobres, y final, los pobres de derecha en su burbuja de privilegios que no son tan privilegios pensarán que el verdadero enemigo son los pobres anti derecha que actualmente se mueren de hambre

En resumen, estamos ante otro triste episodio de la historia colombiana"
4814,"Conozco a una persona relativamente cercana y que es algo conocedora del ambiente político en su interior, así como de los movimientos electorales, él expuso una teoría que se ajusta a lo que usted señala, dijo "" cuando la protesta se radicaliza, lo que ocurre es que la gente se derechiza"", creo que es a eso a lo que le apuesta el gobierno al no negociar, le apuesta a que la gente se canse, se agote de las protestas, al punto de que les afecte, para aparecer no como un gobierno injusto y retrógrado, sino como el salvador del caos y sobre todo del mal que deja la protesta.

Ojalá todo esto sirva sobre todo al momento de ir a las urnas para hacer una elección más madura y consciente, que le pase factura al sistema actual escogiendo mejores gobernantes, y no hablo ni siquiera de votar por Petro, sino de hacerlo de manera más coherente, independientemente de la opción que se escoja."
4815,"Si, pero lastimosamente y con riesgo a que me downvoteeen a lo loco....la reforma de una u otra manera es necesaria. La pandemia dejo un hueco fiscal muy grande y se necesita de alguna estrategia para recuperar la economia del pais. No digo con eso que antes de la pandemia las cosas estuviesen bien o que haya que gravar los alimentos de la canasta basica como lo intento hacer Duque...pero si toca de alguna manera hacer algo al respecto. Todas las grandes crisis no solo.en Colombia sino en la historia del mundo han usado planes similares ""Plan Marshall"" ""el New Deal"" y otros q seguro no recuerdo. En este caso tumbar la reforma tributaria no me parece q haya sido el gran logro del paro como muchos lo quieren poner, sino que lo que hizo fue retrasar algo q es inevitable, espero que alguna nueva estrategia surja de todo este lioy que asi todo lo q se ha sufrido estos ultimos meses haya valido verdaderamente la pena."
4816,Exacto bro. Eso es lo que el quiere. Ellos son maquiavelicos jajajajaa.  Sera esperar en que manos caemos. Yo votare por alguien que me parezca estable y no sea de los mismos. Sera esperar los candidatos que habran. Solo espero que Colombia esta decada vaya en mejor camino y tenga un tipo de renacimiento. Vale soñar.
4817,"> dijo "" cuando la protesta se radicaliza, lo que ocurre es que la gente se derechiza"", creo que es a eso a lo que le apuesta el gobierno al no negociar, le apuesta a que la gente se canse, se agote de las protestas, al punto de que les afecte, para aparecer no como un gobierno injusto y retrógrado, sino como el salvador del caos y sobre todo del mal que deja la protesta.

Tal vez por eso el paro no está consiguiendo nada significativo."
4818,podrian comenzar por reformar la reforma del 2019...
4819,"La reforma habría funcionado, pero hay que recordar que vivimos en Colombia ¿Cuánta plata no se hubiesen robado? XD"
4820,"Yo concuerdo con que la reforma es inevitable. Sin embargo, la reforma se concentra en pedir impuesto a las personas con pocos recuerdos o recursos de estrato medio. Hay muchos mas lugares de donde obtener dinero."
4821,"Si es verdad, ciertamente la corrupcion empeora este escenario.....tal vez esta reforma con el gobierno de turno ya no fue."
4822,"Una opinión impopular pero muy buena parcero!! 

La gente tiene que empezar a cambiar desde el interior, todos esperan que alguien les regale sobretodo en latinoamerica. Mis primos desde Colombia se la pasan diciéndome que les ayude a salir del país y me piden y me piden plata pero nunca quieren dar algo a cambio. Una vez le ayudamos a uno a venir a estudiar (Le pagamos todo) y al final no le gusto por que era muy difícil y se devolvió a hacer nada. Estoy a favor de la protesta y sé que el gobierno tiene la culpa de muchas cosas pero sé que la mayoría de la gente que conozco en Colombia no se quieren esforzar lo suficiente y no quieren cambiar para bien. Ahorita mi primo esta protestando por supuesta falta de oportunidades. 

La izquierda y la derecha es pura manipulación. En mi familia si digo algo bueno de petro ya me tildan de guerrillero y de vago, pero si voy a mi grupo de amigos y digo algo bueno del gobierno de Uribe me tratan mal y me tratan de estupido o de asesino. Todos se la pasan mirando posts o noticias de un solo lado sin mirar el otro y comparar y no aceptan un pensamiento diferente. Los del centro somos más pero nos tratan de obligar a escoger. Si matan a un manifestante, que mataron al vago. Si matan a un policía, que es que se lo merece. La polarización es lo que tiene al país jodido, la gente no se dan cuenta que somos de lo mismo, el gobierno lo sabe entonces usa la estrategia de separar al rival y manipular ambos bandos para que peleen. Por eso llevamos en lo mismo desde la independencia. Mi abuelita me decía que en la época de la violencia la gente no votaba por la persona que era la mejor para el cargo sino por la persona que dijera el partido liberal o conservados. El gobierno nos quiere separados y la gente no se quiere unir. Por eso yo también pienso que Colombia es un pueblo mediocre. El país va a seguir así hasta que se vuelva todo una guerra civil que puede durar otros 100 años y probablemente lo mejor divida el país entre izquierda y derecha. Lastimosamente como muchos me tuve que ir."
4823,"Comparto mucho tu opinión, algo que también quiero destacar es la buena variedad de opiniones en este subreddit, poniéndolo en contraste con otras redes sociales, acá no se es tan víctima de la burbuja  de opinión en la que te envuelven las demás, acá he leído todo tipo de opiniones que aunque no las comparto todas, permiten forjar un pensamiento más sólido y dejar de lado la polarización"
4824,"Toda la razon, tampoco entiendo porque joden tanto con que quieren que tal celebridad diga algo, acaso importa? Con la bandera al reves se demostro que se puede hacer llegar el mensaje a otros lados del planeta, ej lo de Luisito y otras celebridades gringas que dieron su apoyo"
4825,"Diste un paso a la Iluminación. Prepárate para que te tilden de Tibio, Facho o Mamerto según con quién hables.

Y no te preocupes... Así es en todos lados, incluso en los países de dónde quieren copiar lo que sea."
4826,"parce si! estoy 100% de acuerdo. eso se lo debemos a la mala educación del país. la gran mayoría jamas pasa de bachillerato, y por lo que he visto, muchos de ellos no tiene siquiera buen nivel de compression de lectura. Con tan bajo nivel, la mayoría solo cree lo que escucha y simplemente se deja llevar. Para los que quieren educación superior, tienen dos opciones: O son medianamente tesos, o tienen plata. yo trabaje en Admisiones de la UDEA, y cada carrera abre unos 100 a 200 cupos por semestre. Solo pasa como el 5% de los que se presentan. y de ese 5% mas del 30% no llegan a segundo semestre. En resumen: La falta de oportunidades, bajo nivel de educación, y una obsesión de obtener todo de forma fácil heredada de la era del narcotrafico. nos ha convertido en un país de importaculistas que solo se interesan por saber que dicen los famosos y ricos porque ellos quieren llegar a ser famosos y ricos pero sin esfuerzo, y como no tienen educación, no se identifican con los académicos y lo que dicen ellos son bobadas, así que mas fácil le creen a una cadena de Whatsapp con palabras como HUBIERON, HAIGAN y demás horrores ortográficos, porque es mas fácil creer en conspiraciones que en hechos. y es mas fácil echarle la culpa a la guerrilla que a los verdaderos culpables. NOSOTROS!"
4827,"Hmm te daria un premio si tuviera. Yo la verdad estoy cansado con el odio que destilan ambos bandos. Todas las muertes son terribles y no es para alegrarse. Ademas como lo mencionabas Muchos de los Actores-Musicos y deportistas saben solo de su campo. No todos son expertos en Politica para decir las cosas adecuadas en especial con lo confusa que esta la situacion. Ademas poner algo politico los pondria en riesgo al ser figuras publicas facilmente reconocibles.

Shakira recientemente puso algo apoyando a los del paro y que pararan las matanzas. Como la recibieron en los comments???? Le dijeron que era muy tarde que ya no servia de nada su comment. Que mejor se callara y que ella no era Colombiana cuando lleva decadas apoyando al pais mas que muchos. Tambien los Uribistas la atacaron horrible. Si no hablan mal. Si hablan mal. Que pereza. Recientemente atacaron a Juanes cuando el tampoco estaba de acuerdo con las matanzas.

Cuidado te tachan de ""gente de bien"" o ""tibio"" solo por tener algo de objetividad y cordura."

4831,"Personalmente detesto hablar de política con amigos y familiares, ni yo se que tengo definido como bueno o malo pero si algo tengo que decir es que si en internet las cámaras de eco ya son un problema bastante fuerte en los medios tradicionales es aun peor, uno que ya tiene un caminado acá maso menos tiene una idea general de como no caer en estas o al menos no ser tan pendejo manteniéndose a raya frente a estas. Aunque sinceramente celebrar la muerte de cualquiera es un estupidez tremenda, siento que una parte bastante grande del país aun tiene como única fuente de información los medios tradicionales que tristemente desde que empezó todo esto han ninguneado de una forma bastante fea las muertes de civiles que ni uno ni ellos saben con certeza que mierda paso y han glorificado a los heridos de la policía que dicho sea de paso son solo minions que andan comiéndose la mierda de las cagadas que hacen sus superiores por que si de internet aprendí algo es que por unos pocos pagan todos sin importar el bando en el que estés, siempre hacen mas ruido y se le pone mas atención a los que tienen malas intenciones. Tenia ganas de escribir algo al respecto ya que nunca lo hice públicamente, solo queda decir, que la chupen todos los políticos latinoamericanos."

4833,"Parcero, de acuerdo con usted en casi todo

Solo un pequeño punto en el que no estoy de acuerdo, y expongo mi argumento:

Colombia dejará de ser un pueblo mediocre cuándo reciba una mejor formación en la casa que haga que la gente se pueda valer por si misma y no depender de papá Estado, una dónde se prime el trabajo honesto y no la rosca o el fraude para enriquecerse o donde se elimine de la educación en casa la famosa (por desgracia) ""malicia indígena"". Ese es el fin de mi argumento con respecto a ese pequeño punto 

Para los que critican al fútbol, Yo las he pasado verdes cuando niño, y mi mamá sin apoyo del Estado me sacó adelante, aprendí el valor del trabajo y de valerme por mí mismo sin robarle a nadie lo que bien se ha ganado. El fútbol nos distraía de los problemas por 90 minutos cada día cuándo Colombia jugó el mundial del 98, es algo terapéutico  y que ayuda a despejar la mente y disfrutar unos momentos de distracción. El fútbol no es la causa de los males, es mucho más personal, de la casa"
4834,Lo mas sensato que he visto en este subreddit
4835,"Lo único raro de ayer es que entro publico después de que el gobierno perdiera aplazar la copa por culpa del covid y así pudiera asistir el público.

Ahora eso de pedirle a los famosos su opiniones en política est mandado a recoger, ellos nunca ganan al decir de que lado están y nuncan son la clave de solucionar el problema. 

Solo mira lo que le pasó a Falcao por algo que puso hace rato en su Twitter o con el caso de Amparo con Margarita."
4836,"Mira que llego a estar de acuerdo con muchas de las cosas que dices, especialmente con lo de no alegrarse por la muerte de policías (o más bien de seres humanos), pero me parece que estás hablando de una forma como si tú no estuvieras criticándolos a ellos de la misma forma que asumes que te criticarían, te dicen tibio y tú a ellos extremistas. El centrismo también es una posición política que puede llevarse al extremo, y lamentablemente si una cosa es cierta es que el país necesita algún cambio grande, lo complicado es saber desde dónde. Nos guste o no, la farándula moviliza a las personas, y eso es algo que también ocurre en otros países más ""avanzados"". Muchos aquí a duras penas alcanzan a subsistir y menos tiempo tienen para detenerse a estudiar el país a fondo. Puede que eso sí les haga ""mediocres"" pero ése no me parece que sea un comentario que ayude a solucionar los problemas de fondo que llevan a eso, sólo polariza de la misma forma que tú estás criticando, es como decir que este país está lleno de mamertos que no quieren trabajar o de paracos. Lo que sí queda claro es que estamos en un momento en el que la gente está desesperada y no sabe que más hacer. Es necesario tomar acción, pero eso lleva al riesgo del extremismo; sin embargo, no tomarla lleva al riesgo de que no se resuelva nada y el paro al final sólo deje al país más desgastado."

Tienes totalmente la razón. Mira el caso de Amparo Grisales: en Twitter hacían puras bromas de ''¿Qué país le vamos a dejar a nuestros hijos y a Amparo Grisales?'' hasta que ella misma salió a criticar Margarita Rosa de Francisco y al Paro en general. 

Queremos las opiniones de los demás pero nos indignamos cuando no son las nuestras."
4857,"u/kubick123 No quiero generalizar y solo estoy hablando desde mi experiencia. De las 150 personas que conozco bien en Colombia, 100 son jóvenes. Me crie en estrato 2 pero gracias al trabajo de mis papas pasamos a 3, así que la mayoría de la gente que conozco es estrato 3 pero conozco de estrato 2 y de 5. De esos jóvenes el 40% fue o esta en la universidad. Como un 60% de los que están en la universidad solo quieren salir rápido para parchar con los amigos. Muchos de los que estudian IT me dicen que les haga la tarea y no es por que sea difícil si no por que quieren hacer otras cosas o no entendieron el tema(y no se animan a preguntar o a buscar) y después o se echan la materia o al final del semestre le ruegan al profesor que les deje un trabajo para pasar raspando. 

El otro 40% es gente seria que estudia y trabaja. De los serios hay un 60% de probabilidad que encuentre trabajo depende de el esfuerzo que hizo. 

Los que no fueron a estudiar la gran mayoría se fue a buscar trabajo de albañil y a vivir del día a día, los otros viven con los papas sin hacer nada diciendo que no se mueven por falta de oportunidades.

Hay muchas oportunidades que no son fáciles de conocer por ejemplo en mi campo de IT muchas empresas de USA o aquí en Japón donde buscan gente de Latinoamérica o India(demasiada gente es contratada así) para que trabajen remotamente. Hay competencias de programación donde no es necesario ganar, pero con demostrar buena habilidad las grandes compañías de tech lo buscan para qué les trabaje. Saber ingles da mucha ventaja y es lo que más le recomiendo a la gente, por qué no saben la información que se pierden. Conozco una muchacha que se graduó de música pero sabiendo ingles le dieron trabajo en un call center en ingles y le pagan mucho más del mínimo. En mi caso me metí a un culto en donde ellos me pagaron la educación en Estados Unidos y nunca en mi vida pensé que eso era posible.

Es cierto que Colombia esta muy mal y la desigualdad es terrible pero el que sabe lo que quiere puede conseguirse una buena oportunidad que le cambie la vida."

JAMAS los dos lados seran iguales, debido a la moral, valores y el monton de corrientes que existen dentro de estas mismas difiriendo en temas politicos, economicos y sociales, y es importante saber esto para ser mas objetivo a la hora de criticar

Ah, y no, tampoco es que yo quiera que todos se hagan matar por su partido y que anden siempre peleandose, obviamente seria mejor si la cultura colombiana, e incluso en otros paises, fuese menos violenta y conflictiva en estos temas y en otros miles mas"

El pueblo colombiano para mi, es analfabeta o ignorante, pero no mediocre, yo crecí en un ambiente de gente campesina, que gente para trabajar y para hacer cosas increible, esa gente no solo que nunca ponen un pero para hacer las cosas, si no que las hacen, si esa gente no tuviesen la necesidad inmediata de trabajar para suplir sus necesidades y la de sus seres cercanos, creame que todos serian estudiosos.
Pero lastimosamente, cada colombiano es una historia unica.

La vida es dura, tanto, que por más que usted trabaje y se esfuerce, puede que nunca logre algo por las circunstancias mismas de la vida.

Con respecto al punto de la India, hay mucha gente de allá que logra, un buen empleo tanto por trabajo más las circunstancias del empleo, su vida en ese momento.

Fuera de eso he hecho cursos y certificaciones gratuitas. Opciones hay en educación."
4868,"Respecto a lo de elegir comer, el motivo por el que entré al SENA fue porque en mi familia ninguno tenía trabajo, así que las prácticas me venían de maravilla, eran 6 meses de trabajo asegurado y la posibilidad de que me contrataran después para algo, ya que sin experiencia en nada, no estaba obteniendo trabajo en nada.

Eso sí, no fue nada fácil, solía dormir solo 4 o 5 horas diarias para hacer los trabajos, y luego cuando estaba en prácticas hubo semanas en que llegaba a casa a las 2am para estar en el trabajo a las 8am. Pero ha valido la pena."

4874,"Pido disculpas por adelantado, texto largo a continuación.

**Problemática:**

Quiero iniciar con lo siguiente del lado de la educación: Si considero que en algunas instituciones lo que se aprende no es mucho, y hay temas que considero nos son faltantes, ya que muchas situaciones se podrían resolver de forma distinta si todos contásemos con ciertos conocimientos desde la adolescencia.

Aún así, la posición que hay respecto a que es la educación pública la que siempre enseña muy poco la veo errónea, la educación privada necesita ofrecer algo para que las personas estén dispuestas a pagarla, y tal vez que pongamos estos conocimientos como lo mínimo para un trabajo es lo que está mal. Hay algo que me enseñaron hace muchos años, ya no recuerdo exactamente quien y era lo siguiente:

Cada categoría de la educación tiene un propósito, las carreras técnicas están para enseñar lo necesario para la ejecución de una tarea o profesión, siendo más o menso un 80/20 entre conocimientos prácticos y conocimientos teóricos. Las carreras tecnológicas están para enseñarte en partes iguales teoría y practica, de forma que sabes como se ejecuta una tarea y tienes las bases para tomar las decisiones requeridas en el momento cuando se presentan situaciones no contemplables en la planeación. Las carreras profesionales buscan enseñar la mayor cantidad de conocimientos teóricos para realizar el análisis y planeación previos necesarios para la ejecución de un proyecto a mayor escala. En resumen era algo así:

|Tipo de carrera|Conocimientos prácticos (%)|Conocimientos teóricos (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Técnico|80|20|
|Tecnólogo|50|50|
|Profesional|20|80|

**Mi contexto personal:**

Ahora, para seguir mi propia propuesta, mi contexto.  
Mi educación inicial fue privada, y en un colegio que me permitió adquirir unos conocimientos de varias materias como política y economía, ya que eran una materia de 10mo y 11vo grado. Eso si, no era un colegio de elite o algo así, el costo de la mensualidad era de unos 150.000 pesos hace 7 años.

Luego de esto fue la educación pública en el SENA, mi carrera es programación de software (por si a alguien le interesa, espero que no). Para continuar hacia carrera profesional en universidad privada (esto como sugerencia de uno de mis jefes, un hombre que respeto mucho).

**Mi propuesta:**

Hay que hacer cambios en la educación, eso es cierto, pero también hay que pensar en qué conocimientos nos hacen falta, ya que a veces pedimos cosas que de mejor o peor manera ya existen en nuestro país, solo que a veces las ignoramos. 

Pero también hay que reevaluar nuestro concepto del mínimo requerido, ya que si solicitamos conocimientos avanzados para tareas de ejecución, o para cargos que no requieren dichos conocimientos, estamos propiciando un circulo vicioso en el cual cada vez es más un despropósito el tener un sistema educativo escalonado (en teoría primero se es técnico, luego tecnólogo y por último profesional según como se de la vida profesional).

En conclusión, la educación si debe cambiar, pero también nuestra visual de que es lo necesario en la educación y para que tareas esto debería bastar, no tener los tipos de títulos como un adorno, cada uno tiene una implicación, respetémosla."
4875,"Bueno, antes de hablar de revoluciones, habría que conocer todo el panorama, así como las herramientas que ya hayan para hacer cambios, o los cambios que solo necesitan ejecutarse y no implementarse.

Lo que usted comenta de los aviones, debo leerlo, ya que no conozco los detalles. Pero si usted tiene alguna idea de en qué sector habría hecho falta esa inversión, me gustaría leerla."
4876,"La verdad veo la opción de evaluar o cambiar educación como algo viable, también se necesita mayor cobertura, todavía hay un 20% que no tiene acceso.

Lo que tú dices de conocimientos avanzados simplemente no es viable en un mundo globalizado, si hay mano de obra mas barata e igual o me costosa los industriales simplemente no van a venir, hay que ser competitivo. 

Lo que se puede es hacer un sistema por escalafones, muy estandarizado, algo similar a nuestro sistema de colegio, pero reduciría la calidad general de la educación al limitar mucho los temas que se pueder tocar y como se pode hacer. Y tendría otra ventaja, no más eternos en la u."
4877,"Socio, usted la tiene clara no ha pensado en compartir este pensamiento o propuesta en algun otro lugar Aparte de Reddit? Colombianos en Reddit somos pocos, un grupo en algun otro lugar puede ayudar"
4878,"Perdón nuevamente, texto largo a continuación.

Disculpa u/sapajul, no se si entiendo correctamente tu idea, lo que entiendo es esto:

**Sobre el sistema de educación:**

Entiendo que se buscaría hacer obligatoria esta escalada entre los títulos profesionales, de alguna manera, como podría ser por normativa, aunque creo que en este sentido es mejor no involucrar a las leyes, sino que sea algo más de nosotros como comunidad. (Si me disculpas, tengo muchos inconvenientes personales con la idea de que todo sea manejado por leyes o autoridades, siento que quita la capacidad de auto-control a la larga)

Respecto a lo de hacer un sistema de escalones, sobre el papel, esto es lo que son los títulos de técnico, tecnólogo y profesional, en teoría uno debería iniciar preferiblemente como técnico para obtener empleo con mayor facilidad. Luego, con tiempo y experiencia, buscar pasar al grado de tecnólogo, adquiriendo los conocimientos más teóricos. Así finalmente está el grado de profesional, el cual se buscaría cuando la persona desee aspirar a las posiciones más altas y de responsabilidad y planeación.

Con esto los cargos deberían tener una correspondencia más o menos así:

&#x200B;

|Título|Tipo de cargos que lo requieren|
|:-|:-|
|Técnico|Cargos de baja responsabilidad, basados en la ejecución de una tarea ya planificada. (Operarios, técnicos, asesoría, atención inicial al cliente, primera línea)|
|Tecnólogo|Cargos de baja o media responsabilidad que requieran el análisis de la situación para la toma de decisiones inmediatas en sitio. En mi opinión aquí podrían estar: Los primeros lideres de equipos, para equipos pequeños, aquellos encargados de problemas más complejos que un primera línea n pueda solucionar, tal vez todas las versiones ""senior"" de los cargos del nivel anterior.|
|Profesional|Cargos de responsabilidad, encargados de la planeación, administración y gestión de alto nivel. (Gerentes, administradores, lideres de área)|
|Especialización|Cargos de alta responsabilidad pero que a su vez requieran grandes conocimientos de un área específica|

**Acerca de requerimientos de contratación:**

En el caso de lo que expuse, lo de reevaluar que consideramos como requerimiento para un trabajo, lo dije por la siguiente situación:

Algunas ofertas laborales aquí en Colombia solicitan conocimientos o títulos de mucho mayor nivel de lo que la tarea a realizar requiere, y por lo tanto hacen que titulaciones que deberían corresponder a este nivel sean descartadas como no aptas EJ: Solicitar personas con título profesional para labores que se podrían hacer con conocimientos técnicos o tecnológicos.

Esto a su vez hace que todos busquemos dichas titulaciones desde el inicio de la vida laboral, y estas titulaciones obviamente son más costosas tanto en tiempo como en dinero. Así es como tenemos ofertas que buscan profesionales para ser operarios, o atención al cliente o realizar tareas que no requieren de los conocimientos que dicha titulación acarrea.

Esta situación la he visto mucho aquí, hablaré desde mi experiencia. En ocasiones me han llegado ofertas laborales de empresas nacionales, las cuales solicitan conocimientos muy avanzados (conocimientos que tiene uno de mis amigos y primer ""maestro"", el cual tiene más de 8 años de experiencia) para cargos de ""2 años de experiencia"" y con nombres tipo ""junior"" o simple ""programador"" (y el salario que esto implica). 

Por otra lado, he visto ofertas de empresas extranjeras o multinacionales, las cuales por estos mismos conocimientos buscan lideres de equipo o ""programadores senior"" de más de 5 años de experiencia, y por lo tanto el salario es el doble que el que ofrecemos aquí.

Entonces, ¿por qué aquí pedimos tantos conocimientos para un cargo básico y lo pagamos peor que en el extranjero?"
4879,"La verdad, esta es de las primeras veces en mi vida que he decidido compartir mi pensar públicamente.

¿Ustedes tienen alguna sugerencia de formas de tal vez hacer esto?"
4880,"Añado otra historia personal:

En mi primer trabajo, hace cerca de 4 años o así, el equipo de calidad éramos 4 personas, 3 ""tester"" (los que hacíamos como tal las pruebas de calidad) y nuestro líder de equipo. Los tester éramos todos graduados del SENA, e incluso yo era el mayor con 19, con el tiempo un compañero y yo empezamos a desear algo mejor laboralmente, yo quería pasar de calidad de software a desarrollo y este compañero un mejor salario.

Pasado un corto tiempo yo renuncié a la empresa para aceptar una oferta como desarrollador, una experiencia... digna de otro post tal vez. 

Por otro lado este compañero se cambio a una empresa extranjera, y le duplicaron el salario para realizar incluso menos trabajo, ya que en nuestro anterior cargo nosotros debíamos atender múltiples proyectos y trasnochar hasta por semanas seguidas, en su nuevo cargo solo debía ejecutar pruebas ya planificadas e incluso automatizadas (en otras palabras, solo revisar los resultados de una simulación).

Aquí pude terminar de confirmar algo que ya había visto antes, aquí buscamos personal con capacidad en teoría, muy superior a lo requerido y por el mismo salario. No apreciamos ni nuestras profesiones ni nuestros profesionales.

Y nos ha ido llevando poco a poco a tener profesionales mediocres, ya que adaptamos toda nuestra educación y aspiraciones como personas a este ambiente laboral donde el nombre del título ya no representa lo que debería."
4881,"Hay 3 situaciones aquí

En primer lugar tu tienes acceso a una visión limitada de la oferta laboral de cualquier lugar, acá en Colombia he visto los dos casos, ofertas laborales con títulos como director de procurement pidiendo elementos acordes a la oferta como MBA 10 años de experiencia y 15'000,000 y lo opuesto, con nombre propio, PQP pidiendo un Senior Cost Management, con 2 años de experiencia y por 2,000,000 COP. Pero esto es un simple juego de nombres y título, para jugar con la oferta de personal. 

El segundo punto es que el costo de una persona no se limita a cuánto pagas. Por ejemplo si comparas con un salario en USA sin beneficios, tienes que multiplicar el salario Colombiano por 1.57, porque acá hay unos beneficios de ley que son una carga conciderable para el empleador.

Por último es el tema de competitividad nacional, miremos una bolso, tipo Totto, puede hacerse en Colombia, China y hagamos un hipotético USA. Se vende en centro y suramérica, A un precio medio de 40 USD, de esos $40 tiene que salir todos los costos, entonces, china, la mano de obra es barata, el transporte a puerto es casi que grátis, la materia prima es aceptable en precio, en Colombia la mano de obra es muy barata, pero el transporte a puerto es mortal, y los costos de materiales también son altos. En el hipotético USA el transporte y la materia prima son expectaculares, la mano de obra es terrible. Este balance es complejo y varía con cada producto, pero como es un mundo globalizado, hay muchos factores que hacen que la cosa sea mucho más que simplemente decir paguemos más."
4882,"Bueno, respecto a salarios, no considero que una solución sea incrementar su valor, más bien lo considero una problemática tal y como tu la expones, ya que el alto costo de cada empleado para una empresa que causan parafiscales y otros beneficios que aquí poseemos hace casi imposible para una gran empresa la idea de ofrecer sueldos altos, o para pequeñas empresas la idea de crecer hasta ser medianas o grandes.

En mi anterior respuesta no trataba de indicar que el salario sea lo que está mal, sino el perfil profesional buscado, de momento no me involucro con salarios ya que es un tema muy complejo y extenso que depende de muchos factores relativos.

Es verdad lo que comentas de esta tendencia a adquirir únicamente el producto de menor valor, pero no es una regla siempre válida, eso también depende del mercado objetivo, ya que otros factores como calidad, ser producto ""artesanal"", producto ""de lujo"", afectan la demanda. Ahora, si tratamos de competir únicamente con estrategia de dar el menor precio, siempre estaremos en desventaja si queremos a la vez ofrecer beneficios a nuestros trabajadores. Es por esto que en mi opinión, desde el inicio esta descartado el competir en este aspecto, así que es necesario dar un valor agregado a aquello que ofrecemos al mundo."
4883,"Creo que fue Porter el que dijo que las estrategias por precio no son sostenibles, pero el precio siempre debe ser parte de la estrategia. Colombia ha logrado lo que tú mencionas con el café, pero eso requiere siglos de trabajo y un elemento diferenciadores, en la época moderna es difícil y depende de los gremios y empresas para generar la diferencia.

Otros ejemplos en Colombia son el pescado, flores y cacao. Me atrevería a decir que azul ultra mar también.

El problema con esta idea es que como puedes ver es limitada. Y genera competencia interna, y vuelve nuevamente al precio. 

Necesitamos mejorar la competitividad y reducir los costos de flete, la situación es que ésto no se logra con protestas, quejas o violencia. Históricamente solo lo han logrado países con una política estable que favorece la inversión extragera, un ejemplo en Latinoamérica es Chile, aunque ellos lo lograron de forma cuestionable."
4884,"Yo voy primero,

Un pirobo que yo ni conocía y su parche llegaron a mi casa porque un ricachón que me cae como el orto y es el que pone el chorro. Este pirobo era un completo pelmaso, se la pasaba pendiente de facebook, acaparaba la comida y la escondía para dársela a su combo y hasta rompió un pocillo y no avisó que la había cagado.

En fin, este cabrón, incluso después de que sus parceros más cercanos se fueran por las vergüenzas y el ridículo que hacían, nada que se iba. Ahí estaba, haciendo las mismas maricadas pero con gente que llamaba e invitaba a mi casa sin preguntarme.

A lo bien que mierda ese man, no sean como Duque. Si ven que ya la cagaron mucho, renuncien."

Es así también con lo que mencionas, alguien dijo que se deberían suspender todos los partidos y que no deberían jugar porque el país está en protesta, pero ni siquiera cuestionan que ese argumento era probablemente aceptable para no celebrar una Copa América en un país herido, pero que nada aplica para un partido de un torneo diferente que así como mencionas ya venía planificado con anterioridad y que no se celebra en el país.

El hecho de que estemos furiosos con nuestro gobierno no debe ser excusa para querer parar al mundo entero, para que nos vean y se pronuncien, como un niño cuando busca atención.

A ver si descargan esa furia en las elecciones futuras."

Solamente están para hacer proselitismo para la izquierda."
4944,">el sindicato de taxis y su negativa a la reglamentación de las apps

Para eso hay muy buenas razones. Las apps no resuelven ningún problema, y sí aumentan la precariedad de los dueños y conductores de taxi. Además, las apps no quiere reglamentar el sector; quieren desreglamentarlo para poder hacer lo que quieran.

&#x200B;

>Lo que publico Mario Hernández aunque no sea cierto, no es alejado de la realidad

Que una mentira concuerde con nuestra opinión no la acerca a la realidad... No está ni cerca de ser cierto. Además, si así lo fuera, lo único que muestra es el dolor que le da ver a alguien distinto a él y a los suyos ganando plata.

Eso no quiere decir que fecode no sea la cagada. Salir a marchar y a hacer conciertos, pero negarse a retomar funciones es un sinsentido total.

&#x200B;

>el sindicato camionero y si oposición al tren

Esos sí son la cagada. Pero no son sólo los camioneros, son los dueños de los camiones. Esos dos grupos no son lo mismo."

4947,">Las apps no resuelven ningún problema

""La rueda no resuelve ningún problema"".

""La electricidad no resuelve ningún problema"".

""La física cuántica no resuelve ningún problema"".

Así de ridículo suena eso.

En cuanto a que las aplicaciones no quieran reglamentar, pues habrá algunas que sí, otras que no; a medida que pase el tiempo tendrán que ajustarse a las regulaciones laborales de todo el mundo."
4948,"Es claro que las apps no resuelven el problema de transporte, pero si que se necesita una regularización como cualquier otro sector. Justo ahora las apps están haciendo lo que quieran porque no hay regularización, no entiendo como una regularización desreglamentaria el sector de transporte. 

Quieres un ejemplo de como ganan los sindicalista te muestro EMCALI, la mafia sindical que existe es tan grande, que ningún alcalde ha podido con ella, Mauricio Armitage fue uno de los que más batalló y fue el que publicó las cifras y la cantidad de beneficios de un trabajador sindicalizado, llegando a que un aseador este ganando hasta 4 millones y empleados administrativos de nivel 1 lleguen a ganar hasta 15 millones

Si quieres leer el articulo completo de los beneficios ridiculos de los sindicalizados en EMCALI te dejo el link.

[https://incp.org.co/los-insostenibles-salarios-de-emcali/](https://incp.org.co/los-insostenibles-salarios-de-emcali/)

Sindicatos como los de EMCALI hay muchos, y el problema no es que ganen toda esa plata, el problema es que no les importa si la empresa esta en crisis y pierda competitividad como es el caso de EMCALI, solo les importa recibir sus beneficios y listo.

>Esos sí son la cagada. Pero no son sólo los camioneros, son los dueños de los camiones. Esos dos grupos no son lo mismo.

Los dueños de los camiones por lo general son los lideres sindicales de los camioneros, es como en los taxis, son los dueños de los taxis los lideres sindicales."
4949,">no entiendo como una regularización desreglamentaria el sector de transporte.

Por la regulación actual prohíbe explícitamente la modalidad de trasporte propuesta por las apps. Lo que quieren es que se eliminen esas reglas de funcionamiento (tarifa regulada, carros con placa especial, aportes a seguridad social, limites regionales para operación, etc) que no los deja funcionar como ellos quieren"
4950,"No entiendo como eso es malo, al contrario, hasta beneficia a los taxistas quitar tanta regularizaciones y costos absurdos como lo es el ""cupo"""
4951,"El problema es que ellos ya pagaron ese cupo por esa regulación... Haga la cuenta y verá el tamaño del problema. Hoy en día un cupo de taxi en Bogotá puede costar 80 millones. Eso no es un impuesto; es un precio de mercado resultado de las reglas de juego que dice (incomprensiblemente) que en Bogotá no puede haber más de 50k taxis. Ya hay gente que pagó eso por el derecho de tener un taxi legal en Bogotá. Cuando se permita operar sin ese requisito, ese cupo pasa a costar 0; el que ya pagó eso, perdió.

Hay 50k taxis en Bogotá. 50k\*80'000.000 = 4 BILLONES de pesos. 4 billones de pesos que simplemente se DESAPARECEN de un día para otro por quitar esa regulación para que Uber et. al. puedan seguir sacando plata de Colombia. Es un buen ejemplo de la importancia de la estabilidad jurídica."
4952,"El cupo no se paga anual, así que los 4 billones no desaparece de un día para otro, ahora habrá que ver cuales son las cifras de taxis nuevos que entran a circular pero no creo que cada año entren 50k taxis, y con la presentación de algunos taxis, se nota que hay muchos taxis más viejos que matusalen

Otra cosa, el sistema de cupo, ni siquiera es regulado por el estado, ese sistema solo lo usaron los grandes dueños de taxis que son los que venden los ""cupos"" para aprovecharse de una ley absurda y hacer negocio. Que se quite el cupo, solo le quita ese negocio, por eso no les conviene que lo hagan.

Lastima por los que ya lo pagaron, pero el ""cupo"" se debe de quitar junto con muchas otras regulaciones, esto para hacer el sector competitivo."
4953,"Claro, no es algo que se paga anual porque no es una tarifa, licencia, o impuesto del distrito o el estado. Y no se le paga al estado, es algo que ya pagaron todas las personas que tienen un taxi legal en Bogotá.

Pueden vender un carro vuelto mierda en 90 millones siempre y cuando tenga el cupo legal y luego ese cupo se puede pasar a un carro nuevo para seguir trabajando (el viejo se chatarriza o se vuelve carro particular con placa amarilla). Y esos 80 millones no los define el estado ni el distrito; es el precio normal de un taxi legal y la gente lo paga porque sabe que es una inversión rentable.

El día que quiten esa restricción esa gente pierde ese capital; el carro que antes costaba 90 millones ya no cuesta nada. Es capital colombiano, que está en manos de ciudadanos colombianos, se pierde de un día para otro porque ya nadie va a pagar esa plata pudiendo hacer lo mismo con un carro particular. Son 4 billones de pesos que se pierden de un plumazo...

Puede que la ley sea absurda, pero quitarla tiene consecuencias reales sobre personas reales que pierden su capital. No creo correcto que se haga tan abruptamente y menos para darle gusto a empresas con prácticas laborales y de impuestos muy cuestionables pa' que nos sigan ordeñando."
4954,"Una lastima, pero no es culpa de nadie, las inversiones son así, o puedes recuperar tu capital o puedes perderlo, las personas hacen negocio sabiendo eso, no tiene sentido que no se reforme un sector económico solo porque hay personas que perderán dinero. 

Además, estas viendo solo desde el punto de vista del que pierde, tienes que mirar también del que gana, el que iba a comprar un cupo de 80 millones, puede ahora comprarse dos carros y ponerlos a trabajar."
4955,"Según ellos  todos los demás son de Uribe, el único no corrupto es petro.  Petro es muy keynesiano, como es el gobierno actual. Creen que con petro Colombia cogerá el cielo con las manos."
4956,"Porque la polarización cegó a la gente. Para la gente de izquierda o de derecha todo es blanco o negro, no existe el gris. Si usted no es A entonces es B, cuando usted puede ser Q, 8 o #."
4957,La gente está loca y todos tienen el ego tan alto que creen que sus ideas serán as que salven el país.
4958,"Creo que es un fenomeno mental-psicologico del populismo asi como pasa con Trump/Bolsonaro/Chavez. Petro les ha vendido ideas-mentiras y ellos empiezen a sentir que el su amigo y salvador. Petro podria atacarles su propia familia y ellos aun estarian al lado de el dandole honra. Lo mismo le pasa a los Uribistas que tratan a Uribe como un Dios.   


A mi lo que mas me parece gracioso es que Petro es de los politicos que mas dinero tiene en este pais y muchos creen que es del pueblo lmfao. Ese señor vive desconectado de la realidad del Colombiano promedio.  Lo que ese tipo quiere es enriquecerse mas....como la mayoria.  


Yo soy de izquierda economicamente-ideologicamente y vote por petro en las elecciones pasadas pero una vez lo segui en twitter y vi sus entrevistas me di cuenta del riesgo tan enorme que es ese señor. Su lenguaje corporal denota odio y egocentrismo. Es tan malo como los politicos del ramo de Uribe. Tambien la manera en que glorifica a Venezuela-Cuba-Chavez es de miedo. Cuando el agua suena es porque piedras lleva.....  


Yo la verdad siento que hay un monton de personas en la izquierda que tienen la inabilidad de ver las cosas que estan mal en su partido y denunciarlas. Para ellos todo lo que hace la izquierda es bueno porque es la izquierda y si dices algo malo usan la violencia o te llaman ""tibio"" zzzzz. Este tipo de ""niebla mental"" termina convirtiendolos en algo tan malo como la Derecha.  Es como cuando las personas de la izquierda condenan las cosas horribles que hace Estados Unidos pero se niegan a ver las atrocidades que hace China como nacion. La objetividad se ha perdido en los partidos politicos y es lo que nos tiene tan mal.   


Podran atacarme pero yo lo reitero. El siguiente presidente de Colombia no debe ser alguien del centro democratico o petro. Debe ser alguien diferente."
4959,"Porque la gente sigue pensando que la solución está en el Estado o en un político profesional de turno. Por eso latinoamérica no prospera, literalmente siempre se busca un mesías y siempre sale estatista. Nada más ver la época dorada de Argentina con Alberdi y el liberalismo multidimensional, y compararlo con la actualidad. Debería darnos vergüenza seguir pensando así y creer que dándole poder al corrupto se acaba la corrupción y el malestar."
4960,Espero que la gestión de Gustavo Petro arroje algún cambio positivo y no sea un chorro de babas como lo fue AMLO en Mex
4961,"En el caso de los petristas, que son los que yo más he tratado, ellos no entienden que otras personas tienen otras visiones del mundo, que uno no comparte las premisas con las que ellos entienden la política o la sociedad. Por ejemplo ellos creen que supuestamente Duque se inventó los asesinatos de líderes, y que es Duque el que mata a los líderes, entonces creen muy ingenuamente que si Petro llega a ser presidente, esos asesinatos se van a acabar. Cuando la realidad muestra que los asesinos de los líderes son bandas criminales de diversas pelambres, entre ellas, las guerrillas, y que, en tanto esos grupos existan y operen, seguirán ocurriendo esos asesinatos. Es solo un ejemplo de muchos."

4963,Este post es culpa de petro.
4964,"No creas, a nosotros tampoco nos gusta Petro, a quién en su sano juicio le gustaría ese tipo, más de caudillo tiene Uribe.

Pero viendo lo que ha sucedido en elecciones, encuestas y lo quemado que está Fajardo luego de sus guiños hacia el Uribismo, yo votaría por Petro una y mil veces, sencillamente porque el primer paso del largo cambio que se necesita es castigar en las urnas a las ratas de toda la vida, cosa que nunca ha sucedido lo que explica su descaro.

Un voto para un tibio que quiere tener a los Uribistas contentos no es un castigo, es un premio a su omnipotencia.

Y un voto en blanco o para alguien que nunca va a ganar las elecciones, es darle otro mandato para Uribe, sea cual sea la justificación. Esa es la realidad."
4965,"Porque no hay nueva sangre con posibilidades reales de llegar a un alto cargo, si no apoyas a Uribe entonces se piensa que deberías apoyar al segundo con más posibilidades de ganar, e igual si no apoyas a Petro.

Y lo de que si no estás con uno estás en su contra son cosa, lamentablemente, de los fanaticos que hay en los dos bandos no pueden sacar sus cabezas de sus culos y por eso piensan que Uribe o Petro son la única cosa que hay, lamentablemente son los únicos que que tienen una visibilidad alta."
4966,"Hay tanto fanatismo en la protesta que a veces creo que si se tuvieran que operar de urgencia, lo unico que les preocuparía es que el cirujano fuera de izquierda.

Yo estudié economía y por formación sé que la derecha funciona mejor, mientras la izquierda  vende mentiras, pero no soy fanático y si hay un buen líder de izquierda lo apoyo, como en las elecciones pasadas que le voté a Ospina en Cali (aunque este segundo periodo resultó decepcionante), para eso reviso datos y la percepción de la gente.

A Uribe lo acusan de infinidad de mentiras pero uno revisa su gestión como presidente y fue más que aceptable. Mientras otros como Petro solo sacan disculpas cuando fue alcalde."
4967,Estoy harto que me llamen paraco por dar mi opinión no petrista
4968,"Bueno yo creo que el tema tiene un poco más fondo y creo que es donde se aprovechan los dos lados, realmente es que siempre existe parte de las sociedades que quedan completamente desatendidas.

Si te fijas desde la constitución del 91 no se ha logrado avanzar en algún cambio sustancial en cómo funciona nuestro país... 

La función del órgano dedicado a legislar no genera nada que realmente requiera la sociedad y suba quien suba a la presidencia no va a cambiar eso.

Creo que es necesario pensar más en un modelo de democracias directas donde la sociedad periódicamente se le consulte cuál es el rumbo y las necesidades, creo que es es la clave para romper este ciclo de siempre pensar que un grupo es el que nos resolverá todo y que todos tomemos nuestras responsabilidades dentro de la sociedad.

Y desde que sigamos bajo este mismo modelo siempre de un lado van a atacar el otro, creo que el mayor triunfo para ellos es generar esa división.

Uribe totalmente de acuerdo, pero Petro? Veamos por que lo llaman asesino, lo llaman asi porque estuvo en el movimiento M-19 un movimiento revolucionario que es reconocido historicamente por haberse tomado el palacio de justicia, participo petro de eso? no, Petro participo de otras batallas y mato gente? NO.  


En este video Everth Bustamante congrecista del partido CENTRO DEMOCRATICO y ex M-19 con honestidad reconoce que PEtro no participo en ninguna batalla, era un ideologo, que estaba alli por la ideologia revolucionaria, mas se abstuvo de cualquier hecho violento.  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2S\_RGRFGFU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2S_RGRFGFU)  


Entonces la gente lo llama, asesino, chavista, socialista y demas mentiras que dice la prensa, como no reaccionar mal cuando alguien que se come todas esas mentiras dice no gustarle Petro?  


A Petro le tienen miedo porque se comen la vil mentira del uribismo de que nos va a volver venezuela (que en un primer momento ya estabamos igual o peor y que el mismo uribismo con su titere con programa como el chavista alo presidente ya nos hiso dejar ver que ellos son los que no volvireron asi)

Entonces a Petro le tienen miedo por eso pero Petro sabe demasiado de economia, acaso el mismo Duque no hizo bombos y platillos de su programa de venta de Aguacates al exterior cuando el mismo Petro en su campaña presidencial del 2018 ya advertia del peligro de que Colombia siguiera dependiendo del Petroleo y no del agro? que paso luego? pasamos unos años donde el petroleo bajo a perdida, que tenerlo almacenado era perder plata y al contrario el aguacate se vende a mucho mas que el barril del petroleo hoy en dia.   


Que es lo malo de Petro? Curiosamente los que mas estan diciendo que los petristas no escuchamos y que no vemos como otros podrian tener ideas distintas son los que nunca han escuchado las propuestas de petro, abrir su mente y dicernir si lo que dice Petro tiene sentido o no, solo es puro prejuicio porque si Uribe es blanco entonces por lo tanto Petro es la otra esquina, Petro es Negro, ustedes los disque indecisos solo quieren olerse los peos y sentirse los moralmente correctos, pero no hacen una verga para dar una solucion al problema."
4976,"Pues al parecer, y espero me equivoque, es mas un asunto de ""tradición"" el decantarse por un partido político y por tanto el ver que alguien quiera algo diferente es romper esa ""tradición"" lo cual genera malestar a esas personas acostumbradas a seguir con un patron de pensamiento preestablecido. 

Afortunadamente se que no eres el único que desea algo totalmente diferente y no comulga con ninguno de los dos ""bandos políticos"" (yo incluida), asi que no te desanimes que este cambio de pensamiento tomará un tiempo, tal y como lo mencionaste el país lleva decadas polarizado por tanto llevará un tiempo el que la gente se de cuenta que lo que necesitamos no es un ""partido político"" sino políticos honestos que realmente quieran hacer que el pais avance."

A mí me desagrada la comparación Petro/Uribe, se me hace bastante desacertada, Petro será todo lo mamerto radical que quieran y consejero de Chávez pero eso no es comparable a un warmonger como Uribe ligado a tanta historia del narcotráfico en el país y con tantos vínculos con narcos o wannabe narcos actuales. 

Lo que quiero decir es que Petro da mala espina con su radicalismo, zealot and caudillo behavior, y teorías económicas, pero no es comparable a seguirle dando el país a un ente criminal como Uribe. Si las cosas se reducen a Petro y al que diga Uribe otra vez la verdad me da menos miedo Petro que seguirle dando rienda suelta a Uribe."

Los asesinatos no desaparecen porque se elige a un político de izquierda. Pero solo la izquierda tomará las acciones necesarias para evitar que se creen criminales a partir de circunstancias de pobreza. Asimismo, solo la izquierda abordará la brutalidad policial.

Es comprensible por qué la gente pensaría que si un ex guerrillera del M19 convierte en comandante en jefe de las fuerzas armadas daría como resultado un uso más justo de las fuerzas armadas cuando Petro ha estado al otro lado de ellos y policia en el pasado."

También me da cosa de que Petro se ponga todo nacionalista de izquierda y quiera enviar a los venecos de vuelta a Venezuela, si una cosa buena ha hecho Duque es ayudar a los venecos si quiera dándole la oportunidad a los bebés y niños de convertirse en ciudadanos y a la gente que trabaja les ha prometió un camino hacia la ciudadanía, mientras que Petro ha dicho cosas como “hay que ayudar a Venezuela para que los venezolanos vuelva a su país” y eso más estupido no puede ser, no importa cuánta ayuda le dé el gobierno de haya seguirá violando los derechos de las personas además que ese lugar está en ruinas."

5008,"Gracias por hacer ese comentario, y mostrar el perfecto ejemplo de lo que quería decir. Una mirada muy sesgada y desinformada del tema, tal como dije.

Durante Duque no se dispararon los asesinatos de líderes. Han tenido una tendencia irregular. Bajaron en el 2019, 10% (y no estoy citando fuentes de gobierno, sino a Indepaz) y subieron en 2020.

Lo de que Uribe es quien los mata ni siquiera merece comentario. Pero ya que menciona a Uribe, vale decir que durante su mandato fue cuando los asesinatos selectivos tuvieron un descenso más marcado.

Te voy a ser 100% sincero, no tengo idea de que es el Kynesianismo y aun asi tengo dudas de si Petro tiene estas ideas o no, pero estoy abierto a que me explique con fuentes para ver a Petro de forma distinta. 

\>Amistad con Chavez.

Uribe tambien se saco fotos con Chavez y tuvieron sus amistades, pero nadie recuerda eso, Petro ha dicho que en venezuela lo critican porque no es amigo del gobierno de Maduro, Diosdadocabellos ha criticado a Petro, y aqui hay un video de PEtro donde critica el gobierno de Venezuela.

Apoyo a Petro porque se que es el unico candidato que invertira en educacion, y Colombia necesita salir adelante a punta de gente educada, no mas ignorancia para el pueblo.

5024,"Es como  criticar a Uribe por sus nexos con los paramilitares, pero decir que petro perteneció al m19 el cual tenía ideologías de socialismo democrático y decir no petro ya no es así. 

Obvio que Uribe es corrupto pero con petro no tienen ese mismo racionamiento. Por pertenecer a una de las guerrillas de Colombia que quemó el palacio de justicia puede que petro no estuviera en el ataque pero igual hacia parte de esa organización y por lo tanto es condenable.


https://youtu.be/hAx9cbpJCS0

En este vídeo  petro asiste al funeral de Chávez de no ser tan amigo no hubiera asistido, lo de Uribe con Chávez es más protocolo, es más se ha escuchado a petro decir que el error de Chávez solo fue depender del petróleo.


Lo de invertir más educación, y otros gastos que él quiere hacer suena muy bonito pero eso se paga con más impuestos, que tiene que pagar la gente del común que ahora está marchando por los impuestos.


Lo que no saben es que las empresas en Colombia son las que mayor carga de impuestos tienen en Latinoamérica. Por lo tanto si a las empresas les ponen muchos impuestos o se van o quiebran.

Y también más impuestos para la clase media 
Que no quiere pagar más impuestos


Otra cosa de petro es que cree mucho en imprimir dinero y eso crea inflación y pérdida del valor de la moneda."
5025,"Las empresas públicas se costean con nuestros impuestos con la plata que recogen de la gente, de las empresas y si tiene perdidas se mantiene con la plata del estado, aparte que quieren menos corrupción pero quieren más estado y burocracia."

¿Usted sabe leer?"
5027,"No es necesario, eso lo sabe todo mundo, y sus seguidores, puro uribista de closet."
5028,"A ver lo que digo es que se puede replantear como gestionar una parte del presupuesto general de la nación que por cierto se aprobó el año pasado de más de 300 billones de pesos, para invertir en empresas públicas eso sí con veeduría y auditoría de las cuentas. Pero no se pueden robar los 50 billones ni tampoco dejar sin ejecutar parte de ese presupuesto, y viendo este gobierno pues esta claro que van a seguir mal gestionandolo todo."
5029,"Yo pienso que el estado es muy grande y eso permite la corrupción y petro quiere aumentar el estado y aumentar el gasto. lo qué propones sería bien pero estamos en Colombia, hay mucha corrupción, no confío en los politicos siempre se van a robar plata y si se pierde la plata por robo o se pierde la plata por que el negocio no funcionó perdemos todos, además con todos los gastos que va que tener que tomar el estado para que termine el paro y más la pandemia no se qué tanto quede para invertir, pero ya veremos qué pasa."
5030,"Bueno no se donde viste eso de Petro que quiere aumentar el estado, pues él y el sector alternativo piensan en eliminar muchos puestos públicos por ejemplo en los consulados del exterior y eliminar gastos como de camionetas para los congresistas y sus sueldos. Si hablas de reducir el congreso sería bueno siempre y cuando que procuren tener un total suficiente de representación ciudadana, eso debe ser debatido con calma. El gasto público puede ser alto pero eficiente, por ejemplo en países como Dinamarca que es como del 54% del PIB. El presidente puede ser Petro o cualquier alternativo pero lo importante es que el congreso que es el que debate las leyes sea la mayoría de los partidos independientes o de oposición actuales. Esperemos que el otro año cambie las cosas."
5031,Es bueno ver que aún hay personas en este sub que hablan sin insultos y generan debate educadamente. Felicitaciones chicos!
5032,"Estoy de acuerdo con la reducción de gastos inútiles, cargos inútiles y beneficios a políticos, deberían bajarse tantos puestos innecesarios y reducir el sueldo tan alto de senadores, representantes, montón de pensiones  que se pagan a expresidentes que ya son gente con dinero etc.


Ahora que el gasto público y el estado va ha aumentar eso es seguro, según su propuesta.

https://youtu.be/j-yUUIM7idU

En esta entrevista mencionaba su plan de gobierno para el 2018. Allí hay varios puntos en los que se va a aumentar el gasto al estado, crear más estado y subir más impuestos.

En Dinamarca hay políticos menos corruptos, además que pagan gran cantidad de impuestos."
5033,"El gasto público tiene que aumentar de manera transparente si o si, la falta de voluntad política ha precarizado la economía, salud, educación, etc. Yo se que en Dinamarca pagan muchos impuestos, pero yo estaba hablando del gasto público, acá podemos potenciar el agro porque tenemos muchas más tierras que ellos para producir y exportar alimentos. Y con no solo subir impuestos pero para grandes patrimonios y riquezas, hay que evitar la evasión, y eso sería un alivio para el recaudo tributario, podríamos crecer como nación sin duda si tenemos en cuenta los puntos que te digo.

Con el video no me simplificas el por qué quería tener más estado, algo que me llama la atención, porque ya te comenté que la oposición hoy por hoy buscan reducir mayormente los cargos públicos. 
Yo no soy de Petro pero no me parecería una locura si él llegara a ser presidente porque pues es de los que más estaría abierto al dialogo y consensos en estos aspectos fundamentales que he dicho, eso si, no hay que votar por los partidos que hoy son la mayoría en el congreso, eso es lo realmente importante."
5034,"El gasto público debería aumentar respectivamente con la capacidad del país, cómo sabe se cayó la reforma tributaria que iba a recaudar dinero para el gasto público,   si el gobierno se pone a imprimir dinero sería mal para la gente y aumentar la deuda pública peor.

Evasión siempre va haber, cuando hay personas que  tienen la capacidad de mirar y analizar los huecos legales, la subida de impuestos provoca la fuga de los capitales.

En el vídeo se comenta que se van a crear empleos directos con el Estado por sus propuestas de salud y educación.

Tampoco soy un fan de la reforma pensional que el propone.

Potenciar el agro está bien, pero yo pienso que este país debería tener más fácilidades para el emprendimiento y crear productos con valor agregado. No sólo quedarse en materias primas, se debería hacer más énfasis en el sector de servicios."
5035,"Las cosas han estado tensas en Colombia y en el Subreddit :(

5040,Estoy en contra de la corrupción.
5041,"Pues habia prometido no volver a postear nada politico por temor a un ban lol pero solo una ultima vez....

Estoy en contra. Ambos lados no quieren solucionar nada-poner de su parte y si esto va para largo pues adios a Colombia como lo conocemos porque caera en una crisis economica mas grave de lo que causo el Covid-Las Reformas. Yo creo que la mejor manera de arreglar las cosas es votar por alguien que no sea del centro democratico o extremista en las siguientes elecciones que ya son pronto. Los extremos han creado cosas como bolsonaro-trump-chavez-amlo.

Contra los bloqueos de las carreteras estoy totalmente en contra porque quiebra a las personas que menos tienen. Quien le va a responder a todas esos cientos de familias del agro que perdieron todo en Cali y ahora no tienen como vivir?  quien le va a responder a todos los que tienen tiendas de ropa y dependen del traslado de sus mercancias? quien le va a responder a la señora que vendia empanadas y ahora por los precios esta quebrando??? Aqui los derechos de unos no valen mas que los otros. La lucha va contra los politicos no contra los congeneres. Al mismo tiempo como es que Duque hace nada por los camioneros? que le cuesta? un cerdo.

Lo de que Colombia esta mal no viene de duque unicamente. Esto es de decadas y hasta ahora hizo ignicion. Yo no recuerdo que Colombia estuviera muy bien cuando estaban pastrana-samper. La Mezcla de los Politicos de Derecha y las Farc por decadas han llevado al pais a la ruina. Tambien no debemos ignorar que el mayor problema esta en varios de los Congresistas-Senadores-Las Cortes de este pais.....

Lo de las marchas es totalmente valido porque el pais esta muy abandonado y Uribe-Santos-Duque lo desangraron de una manera monstruosa favoreciendo solo a sus amigos ricos por años. Por otro lado hay ciertas personas en esas marchas con objetivos netamente de sembrar una Colombia comunista y algunos pagados por guerrillas-eln. Lo digo porque sigo bastantes del paro en redes sociales y tengo ~~familiares envueltos en eso.....~~

En twitter me han atacado ambos lados de la manera mas violenta asi que no quiero saber de ninguno de los 2. Horrible como el extremismo de Derecha-Izquierda se le mete a las personas. Tambien es un asco como Uribe-Petro han ayudado a incendiar el pais en vez de apagar las llamas. Que les suspendan los twitters. Tambien al ministro de defensa y bolivar.

Solo quiero que esto se detenga y se acabe el covid y Colombia de alguna forma mejore. Extraño la vida de antes que aunque era un desastre pues........ Colombia es un pais con cosas muy bellas yo no lo quiero abandonar."
5042,"Me siento neutral. Tiene cosas buenas, tiene cosas malas. Me gusta la oposición al Uribismo, pero no me gusta la falta de orden o de ideas claras, realistas y articuladas por parte de los manifestantes. Tampoco siento que el paro tenga un propósito consecuente y claro en este momento, y muchas veces se siente que sigue más por momentum que por logros reales o concretos (obviamente en gran medida por culpa de un gobierno de mierda, pero también en parte por ser un movimiento descentralizado y a veces ambiguo). 

Es incómodo intentar trabajar y comer en un país en paro, pero más incómodo es hacerse el pendejo a las verdades de este país, por eso no critico a los que paran. Yo necesito trabajar y el paro sí me ha afectado negativamente, no voy a mentir. Pero no es como que hacerse el ciego y creer en el gobierno más mediocre e incompetente que he visto en mi vida sea una solución realista. 

No puedo marchar, tengo que seguir trabajando (hay que comer), y además me gusta mi trabajo. Me niego a darle la razón al gobierno que está matando gente en las calles, pero no veo avances de ninguna manera con el paro, y parece que mientras no haya figuras de liderazgo fuertes que organicen la cosa, no va a llegar a nada. El paro necesita líderes, estrategas y personas con el poder de unir y convocar. La masa no logrará mucho así."
5043,Apenas ocho votos 😅. Yo creo que las manifestaciones se pueden juzgar separadas del paro y de sus versiones en diferentes ciudades. No es lo mismo quejarse de los efectos de algo en Cali que en Medellín no tiene los mismos efectos
5044,"Una buena parte del problema es que dependamos tanto de las carreteras.

Al país le falta una infraestructura ferroviaria, que debido a las cordilleras no es nada sencilla de hacer, pero tampoco imposible.

Es increíble que tantas cosas se dupliquen o tripliquen en costo debido a que tienen que ser cargadas en tractomula por sinuosas y peligrosas carreteras, y esto seguirá siendo cierto cuando se acabe el paro.

En Colombia todo es caro, hasta lo que se produce aquí mismo, y la dificultad del transporte debería ser la principal preocupación de los próximos 5 gobiernos."
5045,"Samper fue un cáncer para Colombia, cuando llegó el desempleo era del 7% y cuando salió fue del 16%, Pastrana lo dejó en 19% y Uribe lo bajó al 11%, Santos lo alcazó a tener en 9% un año pero con la pandemia se subío al 15%.

Hay muchas mas cifras para debatir y que si estudia quedará mas uribista que uribe."
5046,"Gracias por esa opinion tan significativa. desconocia eso.   
Habia leido que los camioneros tienen como un **tipo de monopolio** y por eso en Colombia no tenemos casi trenes. Es eso cierto?  
Pero si ponemos vias ferroviarias no se irian todos a la calle? que se haria ahi? eso me parece bastante terrible.   


Yo estudiaba por el norte de Bogota y siempre veia pasar el tren ❤️ Love them.  


El otro dia estaba checando google maps en 3D y seriamente Colombia es un infierno topograficamente. Tiene unas montañas enormes y casi todo esta bloqueado por elevaciones."
5047,">Hay muchas mas cifras para debatir y que si estudia quedará mas uribista que uribe.

Bajo Uribe el desempleo ""bajó"" sólo si se toma en cuenta la informalidad, que creció en gran medida bajo su gobierno y que en muchísimos casos no alcanzaba (ni alcanza) el salario mínimo.  La industria manufacturera y el comercio bajo Uribe *decrecieron* 6.3% y 2.9%, casi todo el crecimiento económico ocurrió en la extracción de petróleo y la minería por parte de extranjeros. La desigualdad durante esa gestión también incrementó, llegando a posicionar a Colombia como el quinto país más desigual del mundo."
5048,"No necesariamente es por el monopolio de los camioneros.

El terreno es difícil, esa es la principal razón.

Y pues para comprar un camión se necesitan unos cientos de millones de pesos y se pone a trabajar.

Mientras que para invertir en vías férreas se necesita mil o diez mil veces más dinero, coordinación y poca corrupción.

Es más bien que hacemos lo que podemos, cada uno a su manera, cuidando sus propios intereses, pero a la hora de organizarnos nada."

Mi tio que trabajaba en el agro en Cali fue despedido asi como un monton de familias-conductores-galponeros. El esta pensando en irse para canada-bogota-la costa tiene buen curriculum y contactos........Los trabajadores de esas empresas? a mirar como buscan trabajo en medio de una crisis traida por pandemia  en una ciudad casi destruida (Cali) y seguro tienen varios hijos que alimentar.

Tambien de acuerdo con que el paro destruyo la reputacion del centro democratico. Esto fue como el maximo golpe para Uribe. Aunque por otro lado yo siento que si esto se alarga mal y empiezan a cerrar todas las empresas-negocios por la crisis las personas se iran es a la extrema derecha y los Paramilitares creceran enormemente y ahi si dara miedo.

* ¿Quiénes fueron los más afectados por la ley 100?
* ¿A quiénes afectarían más las fallidas reformas tributaria y a la salud?
* ¿Quienes son los principales afectados por los excesos del ESMAD?

Esas te darán respuesras similiares, ¿verdad? Y qué pasaría si las preguntas fueran:

* ¿Quienes recibieron la mayor cantidad de ayudas del gobierno durante la pandemia?
* ¿Qué sectores tienen las tasas de interés más bajos de préstamos del Banco de la Repúlica?
* ¿Quiénes se oponen más a que vengan entidades verificadoras de derechos humanos?"
5054,"Los ricos, los pobres y la clase media ya venían de bajada"
5055,"ay me equivoque y le di en empresarios, pero tambien son afectados"
5056,"Pues nada más les cuento, mi papá es independiente y trabaja con varias empresas, una de ellas es una empresa de transporte que venía mal desde la cuarentena y cuando por fin se estaba recuperando llegó el paro, y hace poco quebró y tenía una nómina de 60 empleados, la mayoría de ellos conductores de buses que han trabajado toda la vida en eso y que dudo puedan conseguir empleo en lo que saben hacer en este momento tan difícil del país, imaginen que como esas 60 familias, hay muchísimas otras que hoy no tienen sustento"
5057,"En un paro la clase media y los trabajadores, son los que hacen los mayores esfuerzos y quienes más invierten, sin embrago, son quienes mayores ganancias pueden obtener si persisten en la búsqueda de sus derechos. Sí no son ellos quiénes los defienden y los buscan  nadie lo hará por ellos."

5063,Eso no será nada si en las próximas elecciones la gente no aprende la lección y vota por los mismos.
5064,La solución es ahorcar al pueblo?
5065,"La reputación de Petro 

(si es que un ex empleado de Pablo Escobar puede tener alguna)"
5066,"Le puedo empezar por responder desde lo que sé sobre la Ley 100 y sus efectos. Toda Colombia fue muy afectada, positivamente. Permitió aumentar el gasto público en salud; incentivó la inversión privada en el sistema; tuvo un impacto social significativo, cerrando la brecha en el uso del servicio de salud; promovió la protección financiera del sistema lo que ha permitido cubrir enfermedades de alto costo; la cobertura en salud creció muy significativamente; el gasto de bolsillo en   
 salud de los colombianos actualmente es de los más bajos en América Latina.En esa época la esperanza de vida en Colombia era como de 63 años, hoy en día es de 79 años. Muchos otros indicadores de salud del país demuestran un impacto muy positivo.

Con respecto a su segunda pregunta, es mucho más complicada la respuesta porque ambos proyectos de reforma tenían muchos puntos, sobre todos se podía discutir su conveniencia o no. Por ejemplo Claudia López alabó recientemente varios puntos de la reforma tributaria que se cayó.

Su tercera pregunta es una pregunta capciosa.

La cuarta pregunta, los más beneficiados fueron mipymes que pudieron cubrir diversos gastos de seguridad social, por ejemplo. Esas pequeñas y medianas empresas constituyen la gran mayoría de las empresas del país. Y también la gente que recibió subsidios directos.

La quinta pregunta me hace entrever que usted no tiene claro cuáles son las funciones del Banco de la República, y que está hablando por hablar en ese caso. Habla del BRC como si fuera un banco privado y, nada que ver.

Sobre la sexta pregunta, no sé, dígamelo usted. Lo cierto es que los organismos de DDHH como Human Rights Watch no han comprado el cuento de los grupos de manifestantes que han querido vender la idea de que Colombia es una ""narcodictadura"" y han dicho que apoyan y esperan que el Gobierno colombiano investigue y castigue los abusos policiales."
5067,Gracias a la ley 100 yo tanto estudiando como desempleado tengo acceso a un medicamento de 6000 dólares al mes que me permite poder mover mis articulaciones por la artritis y solo pago 3400 pesos de cuota moderadora para cada aplicación.

5069,"Quise decir. Ha destruido el Centro democratico aun mas. La reputacion ya esta destruida hace varios años jaajajaj  


Tengo varios familiares uribistas que les parecio tan abusivo lo de las reformas que pensaban hasta salir a la calle. Aunque muchos no lo crean hasta los Uribistas estaban contra esa cosa pero las personas no salieron por el problema del **covid-19**. Tambien a varios les enojo que duque no hiciera nada con lo de los paros por tanto tiempo (osea militarizar-conmocion interior)  y ya no creen que los candidatos de Uribe sean aptos para el pais porque todos les salen Judas (Esto lo vi en twitter)  Su partido esta quemandose.  


El otro dia discutia con mis familiares sobre eso. Ok les acepte que Uribe ayudo a que el pais no fuera controlado por las FARC hace decadas pero hizo algo mas??????  


Su partido lleva 20 años dominando:  
La educacion malisima...salud-EPS malisima....la brecha entre ricos y pobres enorme......los falsos positivos......lo del agroingreso......campo abandonado.....Santos llego y robo mas (No entiendo como ese señor tiene un nobel) y ahora Duque con amigos como este [señor](https://www.elespectador.com/resizer/kJVYMOC1peNQllQFyYJrXXU7pI8=/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-elespectador/public/GAVGEFFZDRG27GTEGTMEH3JEFI.jpg).

¿De qué está hablando? Con esa frase estaba haciendo referencia a las peticiones del Comité del paro, ninguna de las cuales tiene que ver con reabrir la frontera.

La segunda frase que cita hace parte de otro párrafo y de otra discusión, y además también la sacó de contexto y no hace referencia al cierre de la frontera, sino al hecho de que usted dijo que había que desarrollar el comercio con Venezuela y hacer regresar a los venezolanos a su país (con lo cual se contradice con respecto a lo de reabrir la frontera). Yo sí creo que la frontera debe estar abierta, Duque la cerró por la pandemia, Maduro la ha hecho cerrar varias veces. Pero dinamizar el comercio con Venezuela depende de que exista una economía en Venezuela, y esta cada vez se contrae más y más.

En ese mismo hilo hizo lo mismo, sacando de contexto y tergiversando varias cosas que dije. Le respondí de vuelta, lo refuté, y no respondió más. Aquí está la discusión: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Colombia/comments/n9lvzj/seguimos\_en\_pie\_de\_lucha/gxt501a/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Colombia/comments/n9lvzj/seguimos_en_pie_de_lucha/gxt501a/?context=3)

&#x200B;

>Ahora resulta ser que el gobierno anunció que va a abrir las fronteras con Venezuela aplicando normas de bioseguridad. O sea, mágicamente después del paro desaparecieron todos los riesgos por COVID que mantuvieron dichas fronteras cerradas por más de un año

O de pronto ahora el Gobierno tiene una capacidad de hacer testeos mucho mayor que la que tenía hace un año, por ejemplo? Además de haber negociado y asegurado más de 70 millones de vacunas.  
  


>La realidad es que el gobierno empieza a mostrar su desespero porque sabe que tiene que reactivar la economía a como dé lugar y especialmente en Cúcuta,

O de pronto ese es el trabajo del gobierno? Intentar dinamizar y reactivar la economía, y buscar un equilibrio entre actividad económica y salud.

>la situación del gobierno es particularmente débil porque se quedó sin las cartas de acusar al gobierno venezolano de reprimir la protesta pacífica.

¿? Lo siento, Chávez, pero no. Los abusos de DDHH en Venezuela no dejan de existir en razón de lo que suceda en Colombia. Igual Colombia está en la OEA y en otros organismos, y eso la obliga a tomar parte en las denuncias y medidas contra esos abusos, de la misma forma que tiene que responder por los abusos aquí.

Lo que cita de Maduro no demuestra que tenga ninguna sartén por el mango, demuestra que Venezuela también cerró su frontera, contrario a lo que usted decía.

Mirando en su historial de posts también miré por encima y descubrí otras estupideces que dijo en otras discusiones, como que ""la reforma tributaria se aprueba al todo o nada"" (completamente falso)."
5134,"Esté abierta o cerrada la frontera con Venezuela, es lo mismo. Aunque cerrada es más peligroso en general, te lo dice alguien que ha vivido toda su vida ahí."
5135,"Se le olvida que ahorita en la frontera está una de nose cuantas disidencias de las FARC dándose palo con el ejército venezolano al tal punto que casi toda la gente de un pueblo venezolano se tuvo que venir aca, no lose Rick, eso no da ganas de abrir la frontera"
5136,"Hola. No entiendo por qué la molestia, si incluso tuve la gentileza de hacer una mención a u usuario para que estuvieras al tanto de lo que publiqué. 

En realidad no tengo ganas de discutir contigo. Creo que tenemos distintas interpretaciones de la discusión y, sin ánimo de ofender, no creo que estés discutiendo de buena fe. Yo literalmente inicié mi argumento con la siguiente frase:

>... debería Duque, por ejemplo, dejar de pendejear con lo de Maduro y los derechos humanos y abrir la frontera para que se dinamice el comercio con Venezuela... Nada más por ahí tienes cientos de millones de dólares para empezar a cerrar la brecha fiscal. 

Luego mencioné un conjunto de acciones que **yo** considero pudieran ayudar a recaudar fondos distintas a las que aparecían en la reforma tributaria original incluyendo - y esta es una idea enteramente propia, basada en evidencia y que mal pudiera yo endilgársela al Comité del Paro - de legalizar el cannabis e imponer fuertes tributos a su consumo y comercialización. 

Culminé la lista señalando que:

>El Estado tiene herramientas a su disposición para hacer frente a la crisis. 

**Unas herramientas que claramente partieron de mí - /u/Beginning_Beginning - no del Comité del Paro**. ¿Qué carajos iba a saber yo (o cualquiera de nosotros si a ver vamos) cuáles eran esas propuestas en ese momento? Y sin embargo tú empezaste a responder cada uno de **mis** puntos: ""impuesto a las bebidas azucaradas, puede ser, puede que no...""; ""medidas y proyectos en curso para reducir los gastos de funcionamiento del Estado ya hay varias...""; ""lo de impulsar el comercio con Venezuela no tiene sentido..."", y culminaste escribiendo que ""en general no hay razón para que el Gobierno 'conceda' así como así ninguno de esos puntos. Son cosas que requerirían muchísimo más debate y deliberación"".

Seamos serios por favor. ¿Ahora resulta ser tú estabas era respondiendo los puntos del Comité del Paro? ¿De dónde salió eso y cómo alguien podría saberlo?

Tú expusiste las razones por las cuáles lo de impulsar el comercio con Venezuela no tenía sentido, yo expliqué por qué tu razonamiento era errado y tú contra-argumentaste señalando razones adicionales. Es todo parte del mismo hilo de discusión. Estoy al tanto de la frase ""Obvio que yo creo que debe estar abierta"" pero ello no concuerda con la idea de que ""impulsar el comercio con Venezuela no tiene sentido"" cuando yo enlacé no una sino cuatro fuentes de empresarios colombianos solicitando apoyo al ejecutivo a lo largo de un año para que se abriera la frontera y así impulsar el comercio con Venezuela. Ya ahí no había más que responder, tú hiciste un comentario basado en suposiciones personales que no se sostienen a la luz de los hechos (y a la final tuve yo la razón, Duque abrió la frontera). 

Con respecto a lo demás no voy a comentar. Guarda esta conversación y revísala periódicamente cuando veas lo que va a pasar con Guaidó, con las elecciones de alcaldes y gobernadores en Venezuela, con la bajada de tono de las acusaciones de Colombia hacia Venezuela y el cambio de actitud del grupo de Chile, con la mejora del comercio binacional luego de que el gobierno colombiano se vea obligado a negociar de tú a tú con Maduro y se le olvide el gobierno interino y toda el cuento de los derechos humanos (que Colombia también se pasa por el forro).

A la final a los hechos no les importan los comentarios formulados en Reddit por un par de desconocidos."
5137,"Lo ideal dicta que un gobierno debería tomar las mejores decisiones para garantizar el bienestar de los pobladores. 

Una visión más pragmática (más cínica, aunque más ajustada a nuestras realidades) es que un gobierno debería tomar las mejores decisiones que le permitan mantenerse en el poder, lo cual uno esperaría que implique garantizar el bienestar de los pobladores para que estos los vuelvan a votar en las siguientes elecciones.  

La gente que ha leído este post y le ha hecho downvotes quizás no se ha dado cuenta de que, la ineptitud de Duque es porque no ha sabido tomar decisiones adecuadas, por ejemplo en materia de COVID (el bienestar de las personas), pero aún si no le importase el bienestar de las personas, más importante aún es que no ha tomado las decisiones adecuadas que debería haber tomado si quiere mantenerse en el poder. 

Puede que estando la frontera abierta o cerrada con Venezuela sea lo mismo, pero la percepción de la gente vale muchísimo y hay cosas que son indudables: uno, que Cúcuta está vuelta mierda y el cierre de frontera le dio durísmo; dos, que la gente de Cúcuta lleva un año rogándole a Duque porque abra la frontera; tres, que el Norte de Santander es crucial en el plan electoral del Centro Democrático para las elecciones del 2022; cuatro, que el gobierno así lo reconoce y - a pesar de haber dicho lo contrario hace apenas un mes cuando Duque ""definitivamente descartó esta posibilidad"" - le tocó volver a abrir la frontera; cinco, que lo hace desde una posición débil, con una imagen internacional seriamente opacada, pero negándose a negociar con Venezuela y apoyando a un gobierno paralelo venezolano que la Unión Europea dejó de reconocer en enero. 

De paso, está contra el tiempo en bajar las tensiones y reactivar la economía porque aún no ha acabado el paro y mientras tanto está tratando de mejorar la imagen del país y sacar una nueva reforma tributaria que tiene que pasar sí o sí y pronto, porque si no Fitch y Moody's también van a calificar la deuda colombiana como BBB- lo cual sería fatal. Para rematar, estamos en medio de un tercer pico de pandemia que está matando a 500 colombianos todos los días y que de repente obliga otra vez a cerrar los pasos por concepto de cuarentena (con todo y que ya ni nos acordemos). 

Esa es la realidad, yo no entiendo qué es tan difícil de aceptar. Como le dije al otro usuario: guarde este post y veremos cuál va a ser la actitud del gobierno de Duque frente al de Maduro en los meses por venir, vamos a ver cómo evoluciona el conflicto venezolano este año electoral, vamos a ver cómo Guaidó sale como corcho de limonada."
5138,"Lo que a ti y mí nos dé ganas es irrelevante.

Los downvotes a menudo ocurren porque a la mayoría de cuentas en este sub no les gusta leer posts de las fronteras, Cúcuta, Catatumbo o Norte de Santander cuando el autor es diferente a un extranjero. Suma que recordás las malas decisiones del gobierno y luego citas otro redditor con el que tuviste argumentos y obvio votarán con todas sus multis.

5171,"Una supuesta defensa de la democracia no puede servir como pretexto para argumentar que ""nadie los votó"", ese moralismo nadie se lo cree. Claramente nadie los votó porque son rebeldes, no participan en la vida civil. Así como un líder indígena o uno afrocolombiano difícilmente lograrían representación en el senado sin escaños especiales para ellos (como dice la Constitución que debe ser), a un exguerrillero también se le debe garantizar la participación si se reconoce que las causas de la sublevación eran legítimas (las cuales lo son, el hecho de que se haya implementado el Acuerdo de Paz demuestra que el Estado reconoce que las causas de las Farc eran legítimas). En ese sentido, la representación de las Farc en el Congreso es más comparable al de las minorías étnicas que a las de un parlamentario cualquiera en virtud de que reconocemos que fueron un grupo oprimido y por tal motivo deben tener representación especial, por aquello de garantizar la ""no repetición"".

Pasó lo mismo en Irlanda, en España con el ETA, en Uruguay con los Tupamaros (grupo al que perteneció Pepe Mujica) pero solo en este país tenemos la tara mental de pensar que los guerrilleros no pertenecen a la sociedad o que aparecieron porque sí, puestos a dedo por un dios malo porque sí, que los malos eran los campesinos de Marquetalia.

Los crímenes de guerra fueron hechos por el oficialismo (que aún sigue en el poder) y de eso hay amplias pruebas a nivel nacional e internacional pero por ellos sí no se escandalizan porque se ven decentes, estudiaron afuera y son, en términos generales, más lindos que los guerrilleros."
5172,"Es una falta de respeto comparar a líderes sociales y a minorías étnicas en su amplia mayoría pacíficas a traidores violentos, criminales culpables del asesinato de Miles de civiles, los crímenes perpetrados por las farc son más comparables a aquellos de los nazis en el frente occidental que a la consecuencia de alguna pelea idealista, además independientemente de que tuvieran ideales puros o de qué se les haya oprimido en un pasado distante lo que hicieron no se puede borrar, sólo un porque un grupo haya Sido oprimido en el pasado no significa que los crímenes y atrocidades que cometan están justificadas.

No parece justo parar una guerra sin consentimiento popular, no parece justo permitir que criminales de guerra tengan puestos de poder sin elecciones y tampoco parece justo que aquellos que les pagan el sueldo sean los mismos a los que atormentaron desde hace años.

Todos los insurgentes tienen buenas intenciones no significa que sus actos se justifiquen automáticamente ni que se les deba reconocer o premiar de ninguna forma.

Los crímenes de guerra del oficialismo si bien existieron fueron ampliamente casos aislados, no un modus operandi como lo fue con las farc, la principal fuente de reclutamiento de las farc era casi exclusivamente el secuestro de niños campesinos, eso ya es un crímen de guerra según el estatuto de Roma así como la toma de rehenes (práctica común entre las farc)  Así cómo atentados a la población civil o bienes civiles, el desplazamiento forzado y la instalación de minas antipersonales en áreas civiles, también son crímenes la ejecución de rehenes y prisioneros, la tortura de prisioneros y tratos degradantes hacia ellos. Esta es solo una fracción de los crímenes que han cometido estos traidores aunque por poco y violan todos los estatutos"

5176,"Entiendo su descontento y lo comparto, vivimos en un país con muchos desafíos y dificultades. También es cierto que tenemos una clase política cuyo objetivo de enriquecer sus círculos prima sobre el bienestar general (tanto el gobierno y la oposición). Sin embargo, la economía sólo es una y un país próspero  tiene que ser rico. El esfuerzo fiscal por la pandemia se ha notado. Si bien Colombia tiene solidez en cuanto sus recursos primarios, no tenemos las condiciones para depender de ese sector. El paro ha puesto en relieve la necesidad de aliviar las cargas al ciudadano de a pie, sin embargo, ha gestado un descontento en otros sectores, las riquezas de los países dependen de la solidez de su sector privado. 

El cambio debe verse en las urnas, voten por expertos, gestores y buenos administradores, no se dejen llevar por el discurso populista, además recuerden que un países está compuesto por diferentes factores de poder, los cuales a través del consenso deben alinearse.

Un presidente serio hace algo pero no deja que esto vaya tan lejos. Yo fuera el presidente andaria en reuniones todo el dia-todos los dias con ellos hasta llegar a algo.

Si duque hubiera sido menos soberbio y menos desconectado de la dura realidad del pais esto no habria pasado. El vive en una burbuja donde todo esta bien. Es tan solo ver ese programa que llevaba por meses y a nadie en el pais le servia pero el seguia porque queria su talk show. El tipo tendra estudios pero es un bruto bruto. Le falta humildad. Le falto escuchar a las personas y no solo sus amigos politicos.

Si las personas marchan deben hacerlo como estan haciendo en Bogota que cambian de lugar llevando awareness a todo lado. En ibague se dedicaron a quedarse en un solo espacio y estan afectando terriblemente todos los negocios aleñados. Aqui el gobierno no sufre son las personas porque a duque le vale \*\*\*\*. Tambien las marchas deberian enfocarse donde viven los politicos ricos? entes gubernamentales?

Mis respetos a los que marchan que mantienen el distanciamiento-tapabocas. Shame a los que se lo quitan y se ponen a hacer reunion social poniendo en riesgo la vida de sus padres-hermanos-tios. Hay que ser muy ignorantes para no tomar este virus en serio en especial ahora que no tenemos UCIs.

Los del Esmad-Policia deberian quedarse en sus casas por 2 semanas. No Salir. Si los estan enviando a matar ellos deberian decir NO. Asi se acabaran las muertes. La marcha es pacifica entonces supongo no veremos ningun problema.....  Ellos tienen que no dejar que el matarife los use como carne para sus planes. Estoy de acuerdo en que se necesita una Reforma y no solo aqui en Colombia.

No debemos olvidar que Duque no es el unico culpable de esto. Santos-Uribe-Pastrana-Samper-El Congreso-Las Farc-Billonarios Colombianos.......Aqui son varios que tienen al pais en ruinas desde hace varios años. Todo el batch de politicos ricos-familias ricas  en Colombia son culpables de esto. El Olvido a los campesinos-estrato bajos-medios-educacion-comunidades afro......"

Además el tamaño de las protestas es mucho menos importante que las propuestas que han salido del mismo, que, a mi parecer, hasta el momento, son muy pobres y muy poco aterrizadas.

¿Logros del paro? Que se cayeron los proyectos de reforma tributaria y de salud... bueno, eso es sólo parcialmente cierto porque igual ya estaban casi desplomados por falta de apoyo en las bancadas del Congreso. El tema de la matrícula cero creo que estaba contemplado en la reforma que se cayó."

2) Claro que duelen los muertos por COVID, pero mas que las concentraciones de gente lo que mata es el desastrosos sistema de salud, donde los pobres no reciben atención y los centros de salud no tienen recursos para invertir en prevención. Ni el mejor ni el peor gobierno pudieron haber respondido a esta crisis porque fueron mas de 20 años de ley 100 acabando con la calidad del sistema de salud. Si no fuera por las politicas impulsadas por la ultra derecha colombiana, ciertamente hubieran habido mas UCI para atender a las personas. 

3) Sobre las cifras de policias heridos, se de primera mano que cuando los afectan gravemente sus propios gases lacrimogenos pasan las cifras de heridos. Lo mismo que en el Hotel que incendiaron, no fue a proposito, fue un mal manejo de las armas que usaban para inculpar a los manifestantes los que causaron dicho incendio y las lesiones relacionadas. Sumele los infiltrados heridos por sus propios compañeros. Los culpables de dichas lesiones no son los manifestantes, los culpables de dichas lesiones son un gobierno indolente que se ha negado a hablar con la gente desde el día 1 y hoy se les salio el país de las manos. La gente protestando esta haciendo justicia, los policias su trabajo, los ricos estan haciendo el país añicos."
5205,">y bajemos del poder a esa clase puerca que nos ha gobernado por 200 años

Eso no tiene sentido. Los problemas de Colombia son estructurales, cambiar a las personas al mando o que llegue un mesías que pretende arreglarlo todo, no va a cambiar de fondo las cosas.

Además de que es una frase sin ningún rigor histórico, suena bien (para ustedes) pero no explica la realidad y complejidad histórica y política del país de 200 años."

5213,De acuerdo. Los bloqueos están afectando especialmente a la clase media. Apoyo profundamente las demandas del paro pero creo que debe haber un límite en lo que consideramos como una protesta legítima.

El otro día publique un post para generar debate de una ONG que dice, con referencias las protestas son creadas por los Castro chavistas, y esa publicación tenía unas fuentes mucho más creíbles que tú post de facebook, debo creerle también? Creo que yo me quedo con un medio internacional independiente como CNN.

Según el WEF Colombia tiene el segundo mejor sistema de salud de la región. Puesto 16 a nivel mundial. Lo siento pero si bien falta mejorar, el sistema de salud colombiano no es el problema. No le creas todo lo que dicen los políticos.

Los gases lacrimógenos rara vez se consideran una herida, en la mayoría de casos no pasa de ser una quemadura de primer grado. Las heridas de los policías son por falta de entrenamiento y agrecision con piedras y otros elementos, o se te olvidó que hace unos días quemaron con cóctel Molotov a un grupo del ESMAD, si las protestas son pacíficas para que llevan un cóctel Molotov?

El tema de los infiltrados me da mucha risa, sabes para que meten infiltrados la policía a las protestas? Para identificar a los vandalos aprovechados que solo quieren generar disturbios, porque recuerda hay gente que solo quiere ver el mundo arder, y hay gente a la que le conviene que se mueran 400000 gallinas, que el precio de la comida se duplique y que las industrias entren en crisis, cuentame quien se beneficia de una situación como está, y creo que ya sabes que pasa, porque a la fecha el gobierno ha hecho todo lo que los protestantes piden y cada día salen con algo nuevo."

También comentó sobre otros puntos pero siendo sincero no presté mucha atención al resto."
5232,"Lo siento pero ese infome  
1) Es previo a la pandemia  
2) No tiene en cuenta prevención como parte de un sistema de salud (así que en Col. tenemos practicamente el mismo nivel que CHina, según el informe)

Ahora es aún más fuerte, con más médicos, mayor cantidad de camas y espacios habilitados, o crees que los hospitales y edificaciones que invirtieron simplemente se desaparecieron o van a desaparecer al finalizar la pandemia?

La prevención era uno de los puntos principales de la reforma a la salud, que los protestantes tumbaron. Si había otros puntos terribles, pero este central es interesante que vuelva."

No solo porque ya lleva casi el triple de duración que tenia en la toma de ese dato, sino porque también solo representa las perdidas en ventas que estiman los comerciantes, es decir no tiene en cuenta los daños a bienes públicos que también hay que pagar. Por ejemplo, solo en Bogotá se tendrán que gastar mas de 20.000 millones en reparar el Transmilenio nada mas, y eso sin contar la posibilidad que en los siguientes días sigan vandalizando el sistema^(1).

5272,"No soy experto en la materia, pero entiendo que el informe es por el 2018, creo que en presupuesto de la nación que indican ahí es de cerca de 840 billones y lo que mencioné en el comentario anterior era solo a modo de ejemplo, porque hay otros dos hallazgos de 66 billones y 15 billones, pero no los mencioné porque no entendí muy bien de qué eran"
5273,"Que se halla presentado en 2018 no significa que todos los eventos ocurrieran en ese año (a menos que sea documento distinto al que me refiero, se habla del periodo 2014-2018). El pgn para 2021 es de 320 billones, decir que hay hallazgos de 66 billones es como decir que prácticamente se desapareció todo el presupuesto destinado a educación o a salúd.

Aquellos que apoyan los disturbios también etiquetarán a los alborotadores como manifestantes pacíficos para ganar simpatía por un grupo de vigalantes violentos.

No sé qué está sucediendo en este video exacto. Pero el alcalde ha estado en diálogo abierto con los manifestantes pacíficos. Sin embargo, 5 personas que fueron a la comisaría le prendieron fuego. La policía y los ciudadanos que se oponen al incendio de su ciudad se enzarzaron en una confrontación con estos vándalos. El alcalde alega que las mismas 5 personas fueron a su casa y lo amenazaron.

Es genial decir ""fuck the police"". Pero si crees que tener un grupo violento de vigalantes que quieren incendiar la ciudad y matar a todos los que discrepar con ellos (incluidos los funcionarios electos que simpatizan con los manifestantes) es de alguna manera mejor que la policía a cargo), estás loco.

5283,"Lo que esta pasando en Colombia no es la protesta contra la reforma tributaria. No son protestas organizadas por algún partido político,  el movimiento político espontáneo, sin una estructura vertical, sin una estructura en red tradicional. Son movimientos espontáneos. 

Porque parece difícil? Porque la gente no está protestando por una problema, está protestando por todos los problemas que han tenido y que han sido desatendidos durante décadas. Hay quienes protestan por temas estructurales otros protestan por temas locales. 

Debe haber una reforma Fiscal y Política. 
Que se acaben esas pensiones multimillonarias del Ejecutivo y el Legislativo. No más pensiones a ministros, presidentes y congresistas. 

La corrupción en Colombia debe ser sancionada con medidas más severas. La precariedad estructural (vías, salud, educación) se debe a la plata que se ha llevado la corrupción. 

El voto en Colombia debe ser obligatorio. La abstención es funcional para la politiquería de siempre. En Colombia la política no funciona haciendo las mejores propuestas para convencer a la mayoría, en Colombia la política funciona ""manteniendo aceitada a una pequeña maquinaria votante"". 

De nada sirve que la gente proteste si cuando tiene la oportunidad de expresarse el día de las elecciones no lo hace."

5285,"Bueno... Tengo esto atravesado en el pecho desde hace rato así que supongo que mejor lo saco todo acá...

Para aclarar todo creo que ideológicamente soy anarquista y de manera pragmática soy liberal... Así que la idea seria reducir el tamaño del gobierno gradualmente hasta que desaparezca por completo.

Con respecto a lo que pienso sobre lo que esta pasando actualmente (e incluso desde hace más de 10 años) en Colombia... Creo que la ""política"" acá se asemeja más a barras bravas e hinchas que a política de verdad, la gente ve en su caudillo la solución a todos los problemas y en el caudillo contrario la fuente de todos los problemas, pero como ud dice : 

>nos resulta imposible pensar que toda propuesta o pronunciamiento no lleva un interés en sus carreras, un cálculo sobre lo que les conviene o no.

Y yo opino exactamente esto, el estado es inherentemente corrupto, este en el bando que este, el que se suba al poder dificilmente va a  buscar la reducción del poder del estado, e inevitablemente lo va a usar para promover su agenda, haciendo más grande al estado, ya sea Uribe promoviendo la guerra contra las drogas y el conservadurismo social o Petro con progresismo y su idea de redistribuir la riqueza; pero lo peor de todo es que esto no es un problema que surja de los políticos, ellos solo son empresarios que buscan complacer a su clientela. Es decir, los políticos son el reflejo de lo que la gente quiere. 


Creo que tanto la ""derecha"" como la ""izquierda"" tienen el mismo problema, lo único que quieren hacer es inflar más al estado, quieren más programas para X o para Y, que inevitablemente lleva  a mayor carga tributaria para todos y por consiguiente jode a todos menos a los políticos. 

En cuanto a la fuente del mal que actualmente nos aqueja, La reforma tributaria, está tenía contemplado lo que Petro, Gustavo Bolívar y todos los de ""izquierda"" andaban pidiendo: Una renta básica... pero claro, debido a que eso es gasto estatal solo hay dos opciones para financiarlo, o con más impuestos, o con emicion monetaria.... Pero cada bando ve lo que quiere los de ""derecha"" dirán que duque quiere ayudar a los pobre y los de ""izquierda"" ven que les quieren subir más impuestos.  La protesta y el descontento social por todo esto está totalmente justificado, y me alegra que Duque pierda apoyo, el problema es que la gente no está pensando en acabar con la raíz del problema (el estado), si no que quieren llevar el poder al ídolo que ellos adoran (esto aplica para ambos bandos). 

Los lideres del paro tienen un montón de peticiones que obviamente Implican aumentar el tamaño del estado y por con siguiente el gasto pueblico, pero claro, ellos no van a necesitar ningún impuesto ni van a tener que emitir dinero para financiarse, para ellos la plata crece en los árboles... Y quieren redistribuir la riqueza en un país que no tiene ninguna.

La solución a todo esto? No la veo cerca, seguramente moriré antes de que suceda, pero creo que habra que llevar acabo una revolución cultural donde la gente deje de creer que el estado es el la gallina de los huevos de oro que solucionará nuestros problemas, cuando la gente se de cuenta que la raíz de todos los problemas es el estado y que solo destruyendolo seremos libres y más felices podremos comenzar a ver un cambio... 


Perdon por la verborrea, tengo en mente varias acciones concretas que políticamente apoyo, pero no veo que nadie esté pensando en eso"
5286,"En esencia estoy completamente de acuerdo con usted en cuanto a que la ciudadanía tiene que participar mucho más activamente, y empezar a organizarse mucho más desde lo micro. Además, pasar de la mera protesta o de disentir, a organizarse para proponer, deliberar, crear ideas aterrizadas y basadas en información rigurosa sobre las necesidades del país. Y en que no se puede esperar que un mesías llegue para arreglar todo, cosa que obviamente no va a pasar.

Pero las reformas y leyes no son solo un papel. Esas reformas y programas definen muchas cosas; la gente tiene que ser partícipe de esos debates; con organizar actividades micro de tipo comunitario no basta, para nada. El sistema tributario, pensional o laboral y las reformas que se van a hacer sobre esos temas, nos conciernen a todos y tenemos que informarnos muy bien sobre todo eso."

Colombia lo que si necesita es descentralizarse y pasarle más poder a las regiones, posiblemente dividir la figura del presidente en dos, un jefe de estado  que sería elegido de forma directa y un jefe de gobierno que sería elegido por la cámara y el senado,  así es mucho más fácil que el país se ha gobernado mediante consensos y se pase rápida las legislaciones. 

 Pero lo único que va a sacar a Colombia del atolladero es volverse indispensable en el comercio mundial, dejar de solo exportar cosas sin valor agregado, petróleo, café, flores, etc.  Y aprovechar la posición geográfica  que tenemos,  volvernos un centro de logística para Latinoamérica,  un puente entre USA y Brasil que están entre las 7 más grande economía del mundo."
5301,"El primer paso debería ser reducir el Estado, reducir el número de congresistas y representantes de cámara, tenemos que? Como doscientos setenta y punta? Es injustificable y de ahí se pierde mucho dinero y además da oportunidades a más eventos de corrupción y es más difícil de investigar y judicializar debido a la cantidad de acusaciones solo por persona. También se debería reducir el sueldo de los funcionarios públicos, específicamente del congreso, un senador no debería tener un sueldo tan alto por el sencillo hecho de que no es una posición a la cual se deba aspirar por su recompensa monetaria. 

Con solo esos primeros pasos el Estado empezará a recuperar algo de dinero y no tendremos que estar al borde de la bancarrota cada semestre."
5302,"No soy anarquista esencialmente porque creo que hay temas y problemas en lo político que no pueden ser simplemente resueltos desde lo civil, un poco como la pregunta que hace caes95 sobre la justicia; creo que aún si una sociedad lograra volverse anarquica, eventualmente surgiría una estructura que haría las veces de Estado
Sobre el problema de los políticos y su interés de aumentar su poder, por eso creo que la ciudadanía debe estar más organizada: los contrapesos no deben ser solamente entre instituciones del Estado sino entre la sociedad y ese Estado
Por último, no creo que la ""derecha"" y la ""izquierda"" quieran ambas ampliar el Estado: la derecha busca el Estado más mínimo, que permita el desarrollo económico privado, globalizado, mientras la izquierda si está más interesada en fortalecer un Estado que tenga un papel más dinámico"

Y sin duda, no podemos dejarlo tampoco quieto mientras fortalecemos la ciudadanía: hay que trabajarle a todo de forma simultánea.
Mi inquietud es que estamos tan enfocados en pensar leyes, pero no en las instituciones y el tejido social necesario para que sean efectivas: por ejemplo, la Constitución establece que el derecho a la vida es inviolable, no hay pena de muerte, hay un montón de aparatos legales e institucionales para velar por esto, pero culturalmente somos tan violentos que igual andamos en la calle con cuidado porque ""no sabemos quién es el otro""; eso no se resuelve con más policía, ni con penas más severas sino con construcción de tejido social, con un cambio cultural. Si, desde arriba, desde la política, también se puede promover esos cambios, pero me gustaría que nos pensemos qué podemos hacer desde nuestra esfera de influencia como ciudadanos, como individuos"

Claro, la corrupción y la mala administración corre por cuenta de los políticos, pero eso es un fenómeno social, no natural: no son corruptos simplemente por ser colombianos.
Lo que creo es que en estos otros estados la sociedad civil es más fuerte, no simplemente que la gente esté más enterada, sino que hay iniciativas civiles que ayudan a construir identidad, tejido social y veeduría a los políticos; eso nos falta acá, y eso nos toca construirlo a nosotros"

En cuanto a cómo llegamos allá?

Arrogancia y prepotencia para evitar así ceder nada. Lo otro que hace es promesas que no tiene intensión de cumplir, como en el 2019.

5345,"Resumen(45%) automatico del texto 'La estrategia oculta del Comité del Paro'.

 SEMANA conoció que este jueves, en Cali, hubo una reunión entre el Comité del Paro nacional, el Comité de Paro del Valle del Cauca y algunos integrantes de los llamados puntos de resistencia.

 Allí se acordó una detallada estrategia para alargar las protestas de manera indefinida, pese a la crisis humanitaria y de desabastecimiento en algunas regiones del país y los polémicos bloqueos.

 El primero plantea que el paro hay que ""Repotenciarlo con la acción unitaria de masas del próximo 19 de mayo"".

 En el segundo se habla de la negociación con el Gobierno nacional como una ""táctica"" y dejan claro que hay que plantear ""Las líneas rojas en torno a las garantías para la movilización y la protesta social como precondicionamientos y la participación de sectores que van más allá del CNP"". En el tercer punto del acuerdo proponen un ""Fortalecimiento"" con la incorporación de nuevos sectores sociales y populares, ""Proyectando pliegos regionales"", lo cual claramente alargaría cualquier conversación que pueda darse.

 Aunque el Comité del Paro no le ha contado al país sobre su nueva estrategia, hoy se filtró a los medios de comunicación y generó una gran alarma por el impacto que puedan seguir teniendo estas protestas y bloqueos en la vida de millones de colombianos.

5347,"Querer garantías mínimas no tiene realmente nada que ver con no querer dialogar. Antes de buscar una solución al problema de fondo, lo mas importante es buscar que no se siga asesinando a la población, o que el gobierno no pretenda seguir emboscando al comite.

Miralo así, ¿crees que las FARC y el gobierno de Santos hubieran llegado a un acuerdo de no ser porque los diálogos se llevaron se hicieron en Cuba, que sirvio de territorio neutral? No se hubiera llegado a un pacto si se le hubiera solicitado a la guerrilla que para dialogar iban a tener que entrar en una base militar colombiana. Eso es una garantía"

5350,"Aunque esas peticiones son muy bonitas, altruistas, y necesarias, me parece que no van a solucionar ningun problema:

2) Encender la maquina para imprimir billetes solo va a traer mas problemas que soluciones, pues el peso se va a devaluar considerablemente y eso trae inflacion.

3) A lo bien le confiarian el uso de las reservas internacionales a este gobierno? En el 2020 no se vendio buena parte del oro de Colombia, y donde estan los resultados?

5388,"De acuerdo con los otros posters. Por ejemplo en mi caso la pandemia pegó duro y unas semanas antes del paro pude volver a trabajar. Empezó el paro y nos tocó dejar de ir. Yo debo atravesar la ciudad de sur a norte y uso el mío para eso. También está que el precio de los alimentos subió exageradamente y lo que antes te alcanzaba para dos días ( hablo del dinero) ya no alcanza sino para una sola comida para 4. En Siloe hay personas que están sin insulina por ejemplo y no tienen cómo movilizarse para ir a reclamar o por lo que no hay paso no está llegando la medicina. Yo hoy fui a reclamar mi medicina y había gente que no le pudieron dar completo porque no habían podido pasar los camiones.  Aquí a todos nos está afectando esta situación , no es cuestión del encierro como dicen muchos , es cuestión de que están afectando al resto del pueblo con esos bloqueos y daños a diferentes partes. En mi sector hay ya 3 panaderías y varios restaurantes que durante pandemia pudieron sobrevivir pero que por el paro ya tuvieron que cerrar porque se quedaron sin materia prima."
5389,"Vivo en el sur de Bogotá y trabajo en el norte y la verdad aquí todos o la gran mayoría de trabajadores viven en el norte y uno los ve muy relajados, por más que intenten evitar que la gente llegue a su trabajo no lo han podido lograr y lo único que están haciendo es afectarnos a quienes nos toca atravesar la ciudad de un extremo a otro tanto para salir a nuestro lugar de trabajo como después de una larga jornada tener que llegar mamados caminando porque los desocupados están bloqueando las calles y saboteando, en ese orden de ideas digo que es una cosa inútil el joder las clases bajas y trabajadoras y que las personas que están por el norte siguen haciendo sus vidas como si nada pasara, es más aquí se habla de paro mañana pero en la oficina no les interesa nada y pues muchos van a venir porque aquí en el norte nadie viene a joder a esta gente, nos están es fastidiando a nosotros loa clase baja y nos siguen jodiendo para llegar a nuestra casa."
5390,Primero la pandemia y ahora el paro. Hay gente que necesita ir a trabajar para darle de comer a su familia para pagar la renta y más cosas de necesidad. Hay gente enferma que necesita movilizarse y medicina. El paro fue muy mal organizado y solo está  afectando a las comunidades de bajos recursos. Los que trabajan en el gobierno o tienen dinero e influencias ya salieron de colombia ya están en Europa o en estados unidos tranquilos.

El principal problema en la ciudad es el bloqueo. La libertad de movilización es un agravante, pero el verdadero problema es una ciudad bloqueada donde no están entrando alimentos, combustibles ni **insumos médicos** (en plena pandemia)

5393,"Entiendo completamente estás posiciones y son completamente validas al punto de que se reconoce que el bienestar de los grupos familiares particulares priman sobre ciertos factores generales. Sin embargo, hay ciertas cosas de fondo que me hacen pensar que en si esas posiciones radican en el sobrevivir y no en el  vivir de manera digna,.la gente que es empleadora debe tener un mínimo de empatía ya que al estar desde el privilegio, se les nubla bastante la perspectiva y adicionalmente se refuerza con la perspectiva y necesidad de las demás personas. Y bueno, si necesitamos para el subsitir diario, pero eso es una solución a corto plazo, pregunto yo, ¿Qué pasaría si  ya no lo necesitan a uno más? Lo más factible es que lo desechan y uno se queda sin nada. Ahí, entonces,  cambiaría la cosa, entonces, independientemente que afecte de manera sustancial muchas cosas del diario vivir, lo importante es saber que si queremos que esa desigualdad no se perpetúe más, toca obligar el cambio, tanto primero en uno, y luego en los demás. Porque si perpetuamos la desigualdad ahora con nosotros, nuestros futuros hijos, sufrirán lo mismo y se continúa el ciclo."
5394,"Si, es normal. Hay personas que necesitamos trabajar. Esos bloqueos que se estan haciendo en las ciudades solo es un ""tiro en la rodilla"" a la misma clase media-baja. Los politicos, a los que se les quiere mandar en mensaje, estan en sus fincas o fuera del pais. El bloquear una calle no va a traer a los martires caidos, y tampoco va a traer el peso de la ley a los responsables. Hacer que el metro o el transmilenio dejen de funcionar solo afecta a jovenes y clase trabajadora. Hay formas mas inteligentes de protestar y enaltecer sus memorias: como votar masivamente en el 2022, usar mecanismos democraticos como referendums, consultas, plebiscitos, entorpecer campañas electorales, y enviar las pruebas necesarias a los entes indicados para que se judicialicen los culpables. Se que hablar es muy facil...Pero esos bloqueos son muy desgastantes para el mismo pueblo."
5395,"Los que quieran protestar, pueden hacerlo frente al congreso, frente a la casa de Nariño, o frente a propiedades de reconocidos políticos. Este paro es una Hidra deforme, sin objetivos claros, mucho bochinche y pocos resultados."
5396,"Parce, la gente lleva movilizandose sobre estos problemas por años entorpeciendo lo menos posible el día a día de la ciudad. Pero nadie mueve un puto dedo más allá de cuidar sus intereses y los de sus familias. Están matando gente puta madre! Estamos camino a una dictadura que saca la policía todas las noches a matar gente y ustedes pidiéndoles que no hagan ruido? Eso es como ver una persona desangrándose y pedirle que no haga regero. Descarados."
5397,"Los que están parando no son niños ricos tampoco, también son gente que necesita ir a trabajar para darle de comer a su familia, pagar la renta y más cosas de necesidad. No vagos, no holgazanes, gente como usted que además de sufrir lo mismo que usted están parados re duro en las calles. Se lo digo yo que trabajo, tengo una mamá que necesita medicinas y atención médica constantemente y protesto.
La cosa es que esto no cambia si nadie pone nada de su parte. Ahora usted no marcha, no aguanta ni balas no bolillasos, ni siquiera aguanta el esfuerzo físico que implica salir a marchar. Sabe cuál podría ser su granito de arena a qué las cosas cambien con este paro? Apoyar los bloqueos a pesar que lo afectan."

¿Conocés qué es la Navaja de Ockham?

> *«en igualdad de condiciones, la explicación más sencilla suele ser la más probable»*

Es decir, seguramente son protestantes. Las protestas no son iniciativas con un liderazgo claro. Pueden haber muchos buenos y unos pocos mal intensionados. Eso se vió muy claro en los primeros días que mucha gente se entró a robar a los almacenes de cadena en Cali (mientras otros devolvian artículos robados que eran recuperados por la misma población)"
5415,"probablemente, las personas cuya forma de protestar es violenta, no tienen como objetivo carros particulares ni en general cosas que pueda afectar al pueblo, posiblemente sea alguien tratando de deslegitimizarlo"

5417,"Si esto x100, piense op de que sirve tirarle rocas a un carro para la protesta ? La unica posibilidad que le diria oiga tal vez son protestantes es si sus padres manejan una Toyota blanca, porque digamos que representan a la 'gente de bien', pero si no, son seguramente infiltrados para deslegitimar la protesta"
5418,"Repuesta un poco irrelevante acá, pero posiblemente interesante: la navaja de Occam no es necesariamente una buena heurística. 

En vez de explicaciones sencillas, una alternativa es buscar explicaciones que son difíciles de variar (explanations that are hard to vary). Por ejemplo, parafraseando The beginning of infinity, una explicación que los griegos tenían para las estaciones era que cada año Perséfone tenía un tiempo en el cual podía salir del Hades, y que eso se expresaba en los cambios de temperatura. Esa explicación es sencilla si la comparamos con la explicación que las estaciones son debidas a la inclinación del eje de rotación de la tierra. Pero es una explicación fácil de variar: podemos cambiar Perséfone y Hades por Zeus y el Olimpo, o por la llegada del niño Dios en Diciembre. En cambio, en la explicación de la inclinación del eje de rotación, no podemos tan fácilmente cambiar el ángulo de inclinación, la velocidad de rotación de la tierra o demás parámetros: si cambiamos los parámetros, la explicación no se va a ajustar a las observaciones que hacemos sobre el clima en la tierra. Con las explicaciones difíciles de variar, lo que encontramos son explicaciones que dependen menos del contexto, y que permiten hacer predicciones más precisas.


Ahora volviendo al contexto de las protestas, posiblemente una mejor heurística a utilizar que la navaja de Occam, es la de buscar explicaciones difíciles de variar (no me pregunté cómo, yo solo estoy haciendo bien apunte irrelevante)"
5419,"Y por la respuesta que acaba de dar ya me doy cuenta la clase de realidad que quiere ver... Esa respuesta que en boca de un uribista es «excusas para zafarse de responsabilidad» pero en un «joven que reclama sus derechos» es una verdad incuestionable... Ponen el escenario para que pasen estas cosas y luego tienen la audacia de culpar a otros... Las manifestaciones y protestas SI tienen liderazgos, si no lo tienen es caos y vandalismo puro, dejen de excusarse por querer un espacio para soltar el mandril interno, están igualitos a los tombos abusivos justificando lo injustificable."
5420,"Te di un voto, aunque no estemos de acuerdo, porque estás aportando constructivamente a la discusión.

Te explico porqué no estamos de acuerdo.

Creo que has mal interpretado lo qué implica la navaja de Ockham.

> una mejor heurística a utilizar que la navaja de Occam, es la de buscar explicaciones difíciles de variar 

Estos dos principios no son contradictorios ni mucho menos mutuamente excluyentes. Es decir: una explicación simple no significa que puede estar sujeta a variaciones; tampoco significa que una explicación díficil de variar es necesariamente compleja.

El ejemplo de las estaciones y los dioses griegos, **NO** es un ejemplo de navaja de Ockham. Todo lo contrario. La explicación de cualquier fenómeno a traves de entidades ficticias NO son por ende simples. **No hay que confundir simples (falto de complejidad) con simplista (ingénuo), como es el caso de creer en dioses o explicaciones carentes de evidencia.**"
5421,"Me refería a que no tienen un líder o una cabeza impartiendo órdenes de marcha. Aunque tienen líderes no tienen una *cadena de mando*

Sí un joven decide tirar una piedra a un carro, no tiene nada de extraordinario."
5422,"Lo que quería mostrar con el ejemplo es que la navaja de Occam puede motivar a alguien a encontrar una explicación linguisticamente simple. El ejemplo de los dioses sólo se complejiza si comenzamos a agregar detalles sobre la naturaleza de los dioses en la explicación. La explicación con el ángulo de rotación tambien se puede complejizar una vez comenzamos a agregar detalles (por ejemplo, tratando de explicar porqué la tierra tiene ese eje de rotación).

La navaja de Occam nos dice que no deberíamos incluir dettalles irrelevantes, pero no dice cuando detenerse con los detalles. Decidir cuando un detalle es irrelevante queda a juicio propio (motivado por la dificultad computacional, o simplemente por estética).

Yo no quise dar a entender que la navaja de Occam y el principio de Deusthch de las explicaciones dificiles de variar fueran contradictorios o excluyentes. A lo que quería llegar es a que, con el principio de explicaciones dificiles de variar, el objetivo de la explicación es más claro y funcional: se busca una explicación que se pueda generalizar a nuevas observaciones y contextos, sin tener que ajustarla. En cambio, el objetivo de la navaja de Occam es la simplicidad en si misma."
5423,"Osea que el Comité del Paro, los lideres estudiantiles, los lideres comunitarios y los coordinadores de las marchas son teoría conspirativa o decoración... Eso que usted dice es una necedad, las marchas TODAS son organizadas, planeadas y coordinadas, no son hechas al azar ni producto de un egregor. La existencia de una cadena de mando NO IMPIDE que haya gente haciendo pendejadas sin órdenes, que el ser humano no es una hormiga ni un robot. Hasta entre fuerzas armadas pasan esas cosas, si un soldado quiere usar su arma LO VA A HACER y se enfrenta a las consecuencias haya o no recibido ordenes de hacerlo... Cuando la gente no entiende cómo funciona el poder y su relación con la Voluntad humana se cree esas excusas de cadenas de mando y organización premeditada de actos individuales.

Y antes que lo diga: La unica razón por la que un soldado que abre fuego sin orden es un crimen, y un marchante tira piedras sin una cadena de mando detrás es «normal», se debe a que a la marcha social en Colombia no la tieneb regulada Y NO LA QUIEREN REGULAR, precisamente porque tienen la loca idea que protestar es salir a quemar todo y que por arte de magia se solucione un problema (La misma lógica del abusador en una relación, cree que con golpear cosas se le va a arreglar la vida por arte de magia y la excusa «estoy emputado» lo exime de responsabilidad o carga moral) y porque, le voy a dar el dato, la marcha social en este país solo sirve para mantener los animos caldeados y que las élites puedan fidelizar sus rebaños electorales y afianzar la mentalidad de borrego en el pueblo... Un pueblo emputado NO PIENSA... Dos siglos y no notan el patrón???"
5424,"Eso no es una cadena de mando. 

Un cadena de mando es lo que tiene un ejército. Una persona da una orden y todos bajo su mando acatan.

Una protesta, un grupo de manifestantes, no tienen eso (La excepción es la minga. Pero la minga y los manifestantes no es lo mismo.)"
5425,"Entonces le reitero, usted lo que está diciendo es que tooooda esa gente que organiza el paro son unos pintados en la pared y que las protestas no tienen control... Y con ese argumento se quejan del ESMAD, que existe PRECISAMENTE para controlar turbas fuera de control? Basicamrnte acaba de decir que los marchantes son una banda de anarquistas sin ton ni son... Cuando la realidad es todo lo contrario... En el ejercito, por cierto, un general da una orden y esta se transmite a toda la cadena, los ejecutores tienen plena libertad de acción en tanto comsigan el objetivo, desde un «Capturen elemento X» hasta «Vuelen un oleoducto y luego embosquen a los que vengan a arreglarlo para capturar el objetivo» hay una diferencia propia de lo que usted dice que NO es una cadena de mando. Le repito, policías y soldados también pueden ir a hacer lo que les de la gana, no son robots ni hormigas y eso no anula la existencia de una cadena de mando. Igual que los marchantes. Todo es un tema de orden, ojo con esas concepciones, si el paro no tiene orden y es caos entonces es una amenaza para el bienestar de Colombia, basicamente justificando que los agreda la policía y la ciudadanía misma. Ojo pues, que yo se que esto no es lo que quiere decir, pero es lo que está diciendo sin darse cuenta."
5426,"Una protesta no tiene cadena de mando que cubra todos los manifestantes.

5434,"Lo de bajar los salarios ni soñarlo, eso lo tienen que decidir ellos vía ley aprobada en el congreso y no se van a dar en la cabeza ellos mismos, nunca."
5435,"Esos ""miembros"" del ""Comité Nacional del Paro"" son unos insensatos. Si van a hacer propuestas, que sean viables.

Habría que preguntarle a esa gente **qué demonios es lo que realmente quiere con las marchas**."
5436,Lo que ganan son chichiguas. El. Problema es la corrupcion y la falta de democracia.
5437,"1) Ni idea. Algunos politicos de ""oposicion"" e ""izquierda"" quieren hacer campaña con el paro y la muerte de este caos.

2) Totalmente de acuerdo. Primero se debe arreglar el derroche y mal manejo de las cuentas publicas."

5439,"Pues mira:
primero en el comité del paro hay generalizando un poco exmiembros de guerrillas como las farc y personas que buscan instaurar un régimen comunista. (ejemplos de regímenes comunistas son Cuba y Venezuela)

Segundo el tema del robo es en parte culpa del propio colombiano que pide más subsidios que tienen que ser sacados de los impuestos de los colombianos, eso significa más impuestos es igual mayores recursos administrados por el estado lo que es igual a más corrupción. 

Tercero teniendo esto en cuenta el comité del paro no busca hacer mucho bien ya que entre todo lo que piden es más subsidios y sabemos que significa esto.

Solución posible
Podría ser eliminar la mayor cantidad de subsidios posibles para disminuir lo impuestos así dejar de poner tantos recursos en las manos del estado y con respecto al comité de paro disolver esto por que si lees sus aproximadamente 104 puntos ellos dicen que son trece pero son 104 son completamente inviables, además ellos son en parte los culpables de todo el vandalismo que llego con el paro por que por encima no pero en el fondo son igual de corruptos que nuestros políticos .

Por ultimo deberíamos no pedir comprensión y subsidios y menos impuestos, sino libertad las personas no recibirán más subsidios (que por cierto ellas mismas pagan con los impuestos ) sino que tendrán más dinero a su disposición ya que los impuestos bajan por que no habra subsidios que necesiten impuestos lo que también disminuye la corrupción por último reabrir el país porque está reforma es para pagar la deuda externa los subsidios y todo el dinero que se desperdició durante esta pandemia nunca debimos cerrar el país eso hizo más mal que bien.

Busquen liberarse económicamente del gobierno y recuerden no es una opción más impuestos a los ricos por que la mayoría son políticos y nadie se dispara en el pié."

Stop bullshiting with ""the left"" stop being such a cunt, esta mas que claro que el Gov atraves de su brazo armado es el que esta matando gente, la gente simplemente reacciona, decirle a la gente que proteste no es ""incendiario"" es simple sentido comun, si un peladito de 5 años hace berrinche, eso es un protesta, entonces le va a mandar el esmad por el berrinche a un jardin?, is fkn common sense.
2. Eso es corrupcion, por eso lo primero que hay que comenzar a cortar y cambiar es la hpta corrupcion, cut the fkn titties feeding the assholes, $30 million + extras a month is ridiculous, and getting pension for life after working 4 years is absurd, se entiende que reciba un bono por que le toca volver a conseguir trabajo si no es re-electo y solo deberian ser re-electos por un maximo de 1 periodo (8 años total), and that goes for fkn ex-presidents as well, set that to immediate action and retroactive, guess how much $$$ u have freed next month.

Al menos si un solo punto hubiese hablado de bajarle los impuestos a las pymes para que crear esos puestos de trabajo real o apoyar la industria manufacturera o de agricultura, pero se dedicaron a meter enfoque de genero y subsidio para artistas y cultura. El teatro y cine en Colombia no se consume porque no tiene que ofrecer, por cada película buena colombiana, hay cinco Paseos, pero debemos pagar impuesto para sostener artistas que nadie quiere ver?"
5445,"No es el punto, pero es parte del problema por que no es viable, es importante por que en los proximos 20 años muchos trabajos que la gente ve hoy en dia no existiran, so ""renta basica"" va a ser una necesidad, pero exiten otras cosas mas importantes en este momento."

En serio ustedes se creen en cuento de qué las protestas son para instaurar comunismo en este platanal ?

5453,Si te dirás el lujo de leer todo y no ver por encima el primer párrafo (tanta estupidez?) Bueno entonces ve a hacer paro y pidete un nuevo subsidio que saldrá de un préstamo internacional qu como no queremos pagar con más impuestos terminaremos como Venezuela con tantos subsidios que no podremos subsanar nuestra deuda externa.
5454,"Claro pero cerrar el país es mejor que no dejar que la economía se autodestruya conozco la gravedad del covid pero al menos tienes la más mínima idea de que tanto creció nuestra deuda internacional por todos los subsidios que se entregaron durante el aislamiento, aislamiento que sólo pudo subir los índices de pobreza 7 puntos no se de donde eres pero si lo único que buscas es desinformar, hablar y desinformar sin fuentes los mentirosos y estúpidos como tu mantienen a la gente en la pobreza debes entender que vivo, no, vivimos en un país pobre nosotros no podemos esperar solucionar nuestra situación con subsidios que mira como funcionó de bien en Venezuela."

We need to pay this aid and we don't want to aid other countries, what everyone needs is realize that our problem is not only taxes, police brutality and corruption, because your super Canadian economic aid is not everything that a country need in order to avoid or solve its problems.
We have a heavy problem that could become in a civil war the people who is against the government and the government that want to put more taxes we have illegal military groups that grow really fast and all you bunch of assholes will pay for all your misunderstandings, lies and fallacies with the inonts blood and Lives, more of they you don't deserve any respect."

5468,"Su observación toca el punto más delicado de cualquier programa social que pudiera hacer cualquier gobierno. ¿A dónde se va el dinero? No basta solo con crear programas, se necesita un control muy fuerte sobre los gastos. Mientras la corrupción no se ponga bajo control en este país, cualquier programa del gobierno está condenado a funcionar a medias o a no funcionar en absoluto.

Pero tristemente estamos en el país que no quiso votar mayoritariamente por la consulta anti-corrupción, que no era perfecta, pero era un paso en la dirección correcta."
5469,"En primer lugar nisiquiera debería haber un ""comité de paro"" eso ya es de por sí burocrático. Hay mucha contradicción. No quieren una reforma que pretende recaudar unos 28 billones pero exigen peticiones que cuestan 83 billones."
5470,El comité de paro siempre listos para decepcionarnos y desaaprovechar oportunidades históricas
5471,"La pregunta es ""quienes son los del comite del paro"", alguien sabe quienes son estos?, la misma pregunta me hacia yo sobre estas ""propuestas"" que no solucionan el problema principal y por curiosidad me pregunte, y quien diablos es este Comite?, buscar en inet no da respuestas, so...no hay ningun medio que informe quienes son, ni siquiera los de las cadenas del regimen tienen esa info expuesta."
5472,"Muy inteligente su observación. Efectivamente, viniendo de uno de esos países 'ricos', la gente aqui no se da cuenta lo duro que uno tiene que trabajar en esos países, lo alto que son los impuestos, lo poco se puede hacer 'en negro' (por eso también solemos ser menos simpaticos también). Aqui en Colombia los impuestos también son altos, pero muy pocos los pagan. El otro día lei que la mitad de la población ni siquiera DECLARA renta, y que solo 4% (!!!!) de la poblacion efectivamente PAGA impuesto de renta. Si muestras esta cifra a un europeo, flipa. Obviamente la solución pasará por sueldos mas altos, pero para tener sueldos más altos, la productividad también tendrá que aumentar, es decir menos puestos de trabajo pero mejor pagados, pero con más presion de trabajo y menos 'libertad/flexibilidad'. Pero bueno, la situación como está ahora algun día tendra que cambiar."
5473,"El Comité del Paro son los mismos políticos, es decir, imaginen una revuelta de corderos contra lobos, pero los representantes de la revuelta son otros lobos ¿Entienden?"
5474,"Hay que entender que un pliego de peticiones no es un programa de gobiernos. De hecho, creo que el pliego es ingenuo por lo amplio que es. Ahí hay cosas en las que nos demoraríamos décadas, y que además tienen que ser escogidas por los colombianos en las urnas.

Y eso sin entrar a examinar la representatividad o legitimidad del famoso comité..."
5475,"Creo que debe girar en 3 ejes y los enumeró: 

Reducir la corrupcion, y hacer que la gobernabilidad sea más rápida.

Atender con ayudas sociales a las partes de la sociedad que lo necesitan ,pero el subsidio debe permitirles trabajar de hecho deberían para que el que lo reciba, debe tener actos que está luchando para salir de esa zona de riesgo.

Y el tercer punto reducir las excepciones tributarias que tienen muchas áreas industriales.

Pero se que estos temas con los gobernantes que existen (derecha, izquierda, centro) no van a ponerse de acuerdo, les pregunto es muy descabellada la idea de una Constituyente y así se reforman todos esos puntos directamente...

Saludos"
5476,"No sabía que el paro tenía un comité... 

Dónde se puede ver el pliego de peticiones?"
5477,De buenas a primeras me surgen tres preguntas: quienes conforman ese comité? Quien los eligió? Por qué no piden la renuncia del ministro de defensa?
5478,Y ¿qué propuestas tiene usted para combatir la corrupción? Eso no es tan fácil como decir que los servidores públicos firmen algún papel al posesionarse.
5479,Y cuál es el porcentaje de afiliacion sindical en Noruega y cuanto pagan los bancos? Pregunto por un amigo
5480,"Me parece hasta peor que la misma reforma tributaria hundida ese pliego. 

Los Colombianos tienen que pensar no solo en bajar impuestos, sino en quitar enlaces de codependencia con el estado. 

Eso claramente implica frenar programas sociales, y dejar esos asuntos descentralizados y realmente en manos del pueblo, sin formalismos, sin mordidas, sin chanchullo."
5481,¿Qué tiene de malo?
5482,Ese comité está conformado solo por tibios
5483,Me dolio tanto cuando se hundio esa consulta! Aqui se necesitan medidas anti-corrupcion urgentes.
5484,"La consulta fue ampliamente aprobada por la gran mayoría de los votantes.

Es mentira que no haya Sido la mayoría que dijo si. Fue las trabas que la misma corrupción le puso como el de exigir un número irrisoriamente alto considerando el histórico de votantes incluso en votaciones presidenciales. Suele a toda la propaganda politica que se le hizo a qué ""no hace falta"""
5485,"Y sin comité, o representación central, para qué el paro? Parar por parar?"
5486,de buena...quienes son los del comite del paro?
5487,"Con respecto a la declaracion de renta, quizas el mayor 'pero' es que se requiere pagar un contador, lo cual puede ser un costo considerable para una persona cuyo salario es de $2.500.000 mensuales. Pondre el ejemplo de Noruega otra vez, la declaracion de renta se hace a traves de un aplicativo web super facil de llenar, y no se requiere de intermediarios para nada. 

De hecho, en un sistema ideal, todos deberiamos declarar renta, con el fin de que el Gobierno tenga datos suficientes para saber quien debe pagar impuestos y quien debe recibir subsidios. Pero es esa corrupcion la que no nos deja progresar."
5488,"Es verdad. 

En Colombia la gente no quiere pagar impuestos, así deba hacerlo y tenga con qué. Yo trabajé haciendo ese recaudo y tuve que escuchar cada cosa, varias veces me quisieron ""untar la mano"" para desaparecer la cuentica... pedimos unos políticos y un gobierno menos corrupto y en nuestro día a día hacemos esto."
5489,Y lastimosamente…ese pliego no va a solucionar nada. Solo va a hacer más grande un Gobierno por el que se está protestando.
5490,"Parce, estoy totalmente de acuerdo contigo. No se, no me genera confianzan una constituyente con los personajes que hay en este momento. Pero es un ""boton nuclear"" que se debe considerar."

5495,"Aunque las propuestas sociales que propone son muy ambiciosas y necesarias, no se tocan temas relacionados a la corrupcion, que en ultimas es una de las razones por las que Colombia esta mal."

5502,"Se hace más grande al estado, no al gobierno. La diferencia es importante"
5503,Gracias!
5504,"Esa consulta no iba a tener mucho efecto. El sistema comienza a corromperse en las elecciones, de maneras que no pueden realmente controlarse desde adentro de un gobierno elegido.

No entendi tu punto sobre los sindicatos. Un sindicato Noruego participa activamente de la politica, de hecho, tienen partidos politicos, y se reunen periodicamente con el Gobierno. Aqui los sindicatos solo se limitan a hacer marchas, pero no hay cambios de fondo. Cuantos referendums, plebiscitos han convocado los sindicatos en Colombia?

5530,"Y según los informes más recientes Australia solo tiene un 13,7% de densidad sindical, sindicalización que ha venido bajando desde 1992.

5531,"Y? Por algo acá los electricistas, limpiadores y obreros se ganan lo mismo que un contador o un arquitecto. Imaginese, en las minas de oro nadie se gana menos de $100,000 anuales, y el oro que sacan acá, lo venden a lo mismo que el oro que se saca en Colombia. Y con todo y esa carga laboral, las empresas ni se quiebran ni se van del pais. Será que nos estan mintiendo? Yo no sè porquè le dan tantas vueltas a algo como compararnos con el IVA en Noruega. Dejen de hacer el oso en serio."

5546,Casi suena como si de verdad creyeras que habiendo elegido a otro las cosas serían diferentes
5547,"a el no lo eligio el pueblo, lo eligio la registraduría"
5548,Cual?
5549,Casi suena como si el pueblo lo hubiese elegido y no alteraron el conteo de los votos (esos números todos raros que hicieron).
5550,Yo pensé que estábamos en guerra civil ya. Hace 70 años me parece.
5551,"> Fueron siete las peticiones que se incluyeron en el pliego del Comité del Paro. LR calculó que llevar a cabo tres de ellas tendría un costo fiscal aproximado de $81,5 billones, una cifra que es más de cinco veces el recaudo que buscaría el Ministerio de Hacienda con el nuevo articulado de la reforma tributaria ($14 billones).

Pareciera que no es viable la cosa :("
5552,"Eso es descabellado desde un inicio, pero igual creo que piden eso porque es una negociación y de ahí ceden de parte y parte, igual no creo que vayan a pedir lo básico y ceder terreno en eso , pero puede ser un arma de doble filo, porque van a decir vea lo que piden y todo ese tipo de cosas"
5553,"Quienes son los del ""comite""?, regla numero uno es un cambio en el sistema de pago de los corruptos electos empezando por el puerco!"
5554,Hombre... pero si se querían hacer matar por una reforma de 30 billones hahaha
5555,"Súper inviable, a no ser que nos pongan impuesto hasta por parpadear"
5556,"Puedo entenderlo si es para ""negociar"", pero lo peor es que no hay ninguna propuesta en contra de la corrupción o para disminuir el gasto publico, siendo la corrupción la problemática más importante en el país."
5557,No es eso lo que todos nos preguntamos en la vida? Quienes son los del comité del paro?
5558,Jaja ese golpe no lo vimos venir.
5559,"sí, pero van y le preguntan a la gente si quieren hacer algo contra la corrupción y [dicen que no](https://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias-america-latina-45317930)"
5560,"ROFL, I actually wonder cause donde estan los indigenas, si hay algo esto deberia ser televisado y la gente deberia ver quien diablos es quien diablos, por lo que me doy cuenta el ""comite"" esta compuesto por los mismos del gobierno o proxies, eso no es ""representacion"" de ninguno de los afectados que iniciaron el paro."
5561,"Total ! Pero como yo lo veo es que el problema de la corrupción y el  del referendo es el mismo. Los colombianos no estamos votamos a conciencia cuando toca. 

Comprar votos es barato porque hay pocos personas que están votando y se puede ganar fácil comprándolos. Qué pasaría si todos votáramos? Que sería inviable comprar tanto voto y comprometer tantos puestos gubernamentales. A los políticos les tocaría convencer a la gente a punta de buenas propuestas. 

Colombia tiene una gran oportunidad cada 4 años de cambiar las cosas y debemos reconocer que el poder no está en la violencia sino en una pinche papeleta."
5562,"nah, man ni me hagas acordar, ese día entendí que el problema de Colombia va más allá de los políticos."
5563,"Eso no soluciona nada, en Sudamerica solo Chile y Colombia el voto no es obligatorio, los demás países tienen hasta sanciones económicas por no votar y no es que les vaya mejor en temas de corrupción."
5564,"No estoy hablando de poner una multa por no votar. Se ha demostrado que en los países que es obligatorio votar hay personas después de 20 días ya ni se acuerdan del candidato por el que votaron.

Lo que digo es que se debe hacer un voto a conciencia en los momentos adecuados. Hablando desde el contexto del referendo y debido a que seguimos eligiendo a los mismos corruptos de siempre."
5565,que sea el voto obligatorio en las elecciones importantes? pues seria hasta difícil determinar que elección es importante o no.

5570,"Es posible, las entradas y salidas de varias ciudades estan bloqueadas. En Bogotá el centro de distribución de Servientrega queda afuera de la ciudad por la calle 80, usualmente lo que hacen las empresas de envio es recojer los paquetes en las oficinas, llevar a centros de distribución/sorteo y redistribuir al destino en otro vehiculo. No me consta pero es razonable asumir que la mensajería por compañías de paquetes debe estar retrazada."
5571,"Por lo que entiendo un proceso de revocatoria ahorita no asegura que los próximos presidentes, congresistas y senadores sean nuevamente corruptos. Lo único que se me ocurre que puede ayudar es que cada persona de un voto responsable y consiente por un candidato que en verdad los represente en cada una de las próximas votaciones. Así comprar votos se vuelve algo sumamente difícil de hacer porque les saldría muy caro y además los políticos asumirían el puesto comprometidos con propuestas a la gente que le dio el voto (más no gracias a mermelada ya que no alcanzaría a ser viable si todos votáramos)."
5572,Quien quedaria si duque sale? No entiendo mucho de politica.
5573,"Ese es un proceso que está previsto en la constitución, pero en la práctica nunca funciona, cuántas veces hemos escuchado de una recolección de firmas para revocar un alcalde y nunca ha sido posible, siempre existe un pero."
5574,"Pero tarde que temprano tendremos elecciones (a menos de que se termine instaurando la dictadura…uno nunca sabe). Y pues he escuchado que en las marchas ya están pidiendo la renuncia de Duque. Entonces, en el caso de que este man renuncie, durante ese proceso de transición quedaríamos a Merced del ejercito o del presidente del senado (el Char)."

5592,"Que tengan semejanzas caudillistas no me parece suficiente para decir que ""son idénticos"". Uno ha ostentado el poder por lo menos por 8 años, y el otro apenas viene agarrando tracción como una figura antagónica (irónicamente, producto de los mismos partidarios de Uribe. De otro modo, se hubiese quedado con el mismo perfil con el que tienen a Cepeda).

Más allá de la cuestionable alcaldía que tuvo, su pasado en el M-19 y su video de las bolsas, la influencia de Petro aún palidece frente a la de Uribe. Sin mencionar que la dimensión de sus escándalos políticos es completamente desigual.

Considero que igualarlos es trivializar una coyuntura política mucho más compleja y que tiene diferentes aristas, y no solo dos polos y un centro (prácticamente la narración maniqueista que sustenta al uribismo en vacas flacas)."
5593,"por qué? ósea no es como si uno tuviera una gigantesca responsabilidad en la situación actual del pais, la corrupción, falsos positivos, que el pais este en manos de los grandes empresarios fanáticos del monopolio, el bipartidismo y la satanización de la izquierda política o cualquiera que piense diferente a el

mientras que el otro es un progresista, que no es corrupto, que no miente y que la única razón de por que les cae mal es por que el uribismo supo como manchar su reputación, porque no, Petro y Uribe son completamente diferentes, no solo en política"

5597,"Frente a la responsabiliad histórica, sin duda estoy con usted. Hay algunas cosas que quedaron pendientes (o cuanto menos sin mencionar) de la administración de Petro en Bogotá (las cuales, sin duda alguna, no se comparan con lo que realizó Uribe). 

Frente a la forma de realizar polítca, y a su forma de administrar, difiero profundamente con usted."
5598,"Petro no sataniza al que piensa diferente a él? wuau primera vez que lo escucho. Según él mismo, se atribuye la creación de algo asi como dos mil quinientos nuevos empleos en Bogotá, claro lo que no dice es incrementó la burocracia y las corbatas, así hasta yo genero 2.500 empleos nuevos (no sostenibles).

 En cuánto al progresismo, el mas famoso de Latinoamérica ha sido Chávez dicho también por el mismo comandante en una de tantas entrevistas en 1998 semanas antes de su elección y luego ratificado por Petro en 2002 (también disponible en YouTube por si acaso) entonces pues ser progresista no es sinónimo de maravilla o que sea el ""cambio"".     

 Colombia no necesita mas Mesías y tristemente el señor Petro se ve así mismo como tal (fuentes disponibles, si las necesitas las busco y te las paso) y decir algo ligeramente negativo de él o mostrarse en desacuerdo con él es ganarse la enemistad de sus huestes. (véase como se expresa Levy Rincón de Daniel Coronel por no ser petrista y no desgastarse en ese debate).

 Adicionalmente Petro no le tiembla la lengua para mentir con relación a sus cifras, véase en su Twitter cuando el mismo se echa flores diciendo que bajo la pobreza dimensional de Bogotá durante su gestión, claro omitió decir que fruto de las regalías de la nación en la década dorada de las materias primas todo el país la bajó? Que es real en lo que el dice? Entonces, cuando la gente dice que Uribe y Petro son lo mismo es porque sienten que son mas  los rasgos que los acercan que los que los alejan, cuál entonces es el motivo para desconocer el sentir de muchos? O más bien por que lo creen o no le creen? O te parece que cuándo el se llena la boca diciendo, YO saqué 8 millones de votos será que el man no dice, coño votaron por mí porque no querían votar por Porky? No, no lo piensa... el man está convencido que el los sacó porque viene de una costilla de Jesus,  bueno eso último no tengo respaldo me dejé llevar.
 Finalmente por que HDP tenemos que votar por X para que no quede Y? Por que HDP nos perdemos de gente buena por eso? Porque  la  gente tiene que votar con miedo o con rabia? O tu crees que el innombrable llegó por qué? Porque la gente tenía rabia estaba podrida de la guerrilla. Las condiciones son similares solo que para el otro lado con un personaje con los mismos rasgos del otro pero de izquierda. Entonces? Para dónde vamos?"
5599,"el peor error que podemos hacer es creer que porque son disidentes son mejores, este gobierno es una mierda y si gobierna la izquierda lo va a hacer igual, este gobierno te mete una reforma tributaria en medio de pandemia como unos hijos de puta y un gobierno de izquierdas tambien te va a subir los impuestos pero con palabras mas bonitas como por ejemplo ""justicia social"" ""renta basica universal"" o ""estado de bienestar"" igual te quieren clavar e igual te quieren robar, misma mierda solo que uno llegó al poder y el otro no"

Mire, creo que me exprese mal en varios sentidos, a ver, me dije que no mentía refiriéndome a como lo hace uribe y en general los uribistas, no que inflaba números y se atribuía cosas que el no hizo o que no necesariamente fueron por el, me salte la parte de la comparación jaja
Ahora, hablar de Chávez como progresista... Hasta donde yo se era más socialista pero bueno , en cualquier caso, el man fue un dictador que no supo manejar a Venezuela y jodio en todo lo que se podía joder y hasta más, pero no mms, chavez y Petro son polos opuestos dentro de la izquierda por favor
Por último, quiero agregar que si bien apoyo a Petro sobre los candidatos actuales, obviamente estoy en contra de muchas de sus ideas, pero con los hptas uribistas corruptos y asesinos y con los de centro hipócritas y muchos corruptos, pues Petro es la mejor opcion"

5678,"Se lo voy a decir de la manera mas cruda posible:

1.- No hay un objetivo definido en esas protestas. Sacar a duque?, nuevas elecciones?, eliminar el congreso?.

2.- Al no haber objetivo y afectar directamente el aparato productivo (que nada tiene que ver con el sector político) la gente comienza a cansarse.

3.- Los vandalos que son menos del 5% de los protestantes (puede haber hasta infiltrados), terminan por desacreditar las protestas.

4.- Los politicos de izquierda que buscan pescar en rio revuelto y que no les interesa el pueblo colombiano, pero reciben financiamiento de paises que odian a Duque (por ejemplo Venezuela), continuan en redes sociales aupando la protesta (nuevamente sin un objetivo definido), solo para mostrar poder ante los conservadores y negociar por debajo de la mesa con ellos (sigue estando fuera el pueblo de todo esto).

Por todo esto no veo las protestas por buen camino, pienso mejor que de este proceso debe nacer un lider diferente que aglutine a todos los afectados y que logre hacer un peso suficiente para que a través del voto puedan cambiar el destino del pais."
5679,"Quizás el diálogo y la vida estén garantizados en una democracia saludable y plena... pero la nuestra está enferma y es débil. Es suficientemente ver el mal direccionamiento de la policía la cual de forma con doctrina militar y no como un cuerpo cívico garante de derechos humanos humanos, a esto súmele que es un organismo muy susceptible a la corrupción y no tienen evaluaciones psicológicas rígidas ni formación apropiada en DIH.

Usted puede inferir la poca disposición al diálogo de un gobierno cuando comienza con el discurso del enemigo interno y actúa de forma ineficiente para que la propia llama de la protesta se ahogue por extenderse tanto tiempo"

De hecho, hubo un diálogo entre los líderes de la protesta y el gobierno. Pero no es suficiente que la gente no sea feliz hasta que haya un cambio de gobierno.

Colombia es un país violento en 2020 hubo 12018 asesinatos. Lo que significa que en promedio 33 personas son asesinadas todos los días. El 40% de la población vive en la pobreza y solo el 25% más rico del país es lo que podemos considerar de clase media. La mayoría son pobres

Si no le gusta que los pobres tomen sus contenedores como rehenes.  Entonces espero que en las próximas elecciones voten por alguien que aumente sus impuestos para mantener a los pobres, para que puedan comer, para que puedan obtener una educación y comprender cómo funcionan realmente los mercados.

Desacreditan la protesta de la manera en que se cambia el foco de discusión al accionar de esos reducidos grupos, apoyándose más la idea en sectores contrarios de usar la fuerza porque ""vandalizaran y robaran nuestros negocios"" o similares. Dejando que esos mismos grupos y el gobierno ""legitimen"" sus crímenes mientras que las protestas pacíficas y sus líneas de defensa e información (Primera Línea, ONG's, periodistas, médicos etc) son los que pagan el pato.

Además de que esas no-pacificas revoluciones o revueltas a las que te refieres son más parecidas a lo que ha hecho las FARC, el ELN, el M-19 etc en este país (no los aplaudo ni los apoyo) que un grupo de gente quemando un banco o un autobus mientras que la primera línea está siendo pisoteada. Debido a que esas revoluciones han sido hijueputas guerras civiles jodidamente sangrientas y bien armadas. No un grupo de gente que quema un edificio o medio asaltan una tienda (se roban solo los televisores, sera que se los irán a comer o vender) y se escudan entre la población civil. Que si los críticas, te dicen que están tirando la tiranía rompiendo uno que otro vidrio o que ""nada se ha hecho con protestas pacíficas"",  pero si les propones que la población civil tenga armas para su defensa o cosas así, es que se necesita un país en paz o ""nada se resuelve con violencia""."

La ONG Temblores dice que estas desapariciones se adjudican al Estado porque las personas reportan a sus familiares que la policía se los están llevando a un sitio X y cuando los familiares van a preguntar al sitio X no les dan razón de dónde están sus desaparecidos, de manera que así se determina (se filtra por así decirlo) que no son desapariciones independientes del Paro. No hay que esperar ningún tiempo para reportar desaparecidos (a veces dicen que toca esperar 72 horas pero eso es falso), se reporta a alguien como desaparecido en el momento que no se tiene conocimiento de su paradero a pesar de que la policía les dice que están en un lugar en el que realmente no están."

¿De qué está hablando? Con esa frase estaba haciendo referencia a las peticiones del Comité del paro, ninguna de las cuales tiene que ver con reabrir la frontera.

La segunda frase que cita hace parte de otro párrafo y de otra discusión, y además también la sacó de contexto y no hace referencia al cierre de la frontera, sino al hecho de que usted dijo que había que desarrollar el comercio con Venezuela y hacer regresar a los venezolanos a su país (con lo cual se contradice con respecto a lo de reabrir la frontera). Yo sí creo que la frontera debe estar abierta, Duque la cerró por la pandemia, Maduro la ha hecho cerrar varias veces. Pero dinamizar el comercio con Venezuela depende de que exista una economía en Venezuela, y esta cada vez se contrae más y más.

>Ahora resulta ser que el gobierno anunció que va a abrir las fronteras con Venezuela aplicando normas de bioseguridad. O sea, mágicamente después del paro desaparecieron todos los riesgos por COVID que mantuvieron dichas fronteras cerradas por más de un año

O de pronto ahora el Gobierno tiene una capacidad de hacer testeos mucho mayor que la que tenía hace un año, por ejemplo? Además de haber negociado y asegurado más de 70 millones de vacunas.  
  


>La realidad es que el gobierno empieza a mostrar su desespero porque sabe que tiene que reactivar la economía a como dé lugar y especialmente en Cúcuta,

O de pronto ese es el trabajo del gobierno? Intentar dinamizar y reactivar la economía, y buscar un equilibrio entre actividad económica y salud.

>la situación del gobierno es particularmente débil porque se quedó sin las cartas de acusar al gobierno venezolano de reprimir la protesta pacífica.

¿? Lo siento, Chávez, pero no. Los abusos de DDHH en Venezuela no dejan de existir en razón de lo que suceda en Colombia. Igual Colombia está en la OEA y en otros organismos, y eso la obliga a tomar parte en las denuncias y medidas contra esos abusos, de la misma forma que tiene que responder por los abusos aquí.

Lo que cita de Maduro no demuestra que tenga ninguna sartén por el mango, demuestra que Venezuela también cerró su frontera, contrario a lo que usted decía.

Mirando en su historial de posts también miré por encima y descubrí otras estupideces que dijo en otras discusiones, como que ""la reforma tributaria se aprueba al todo o nada"" (completamente falso)."
5736,"Esté abierta o cerrada la frontera con Venezuela, es lo mismo. Aunque cerrada es más peligroso en general, te lo dice alguien que ha vivido toda su vida ahí."
5737,"Se le olvida que ahorita en la frontera está una de nose cuantas disidencias de las FARC dándose palo con el ejército venezolano al tal punto que casi toda la gente de un pueblo venezolano se tuvo que venir aca, no lose Rick, eso no da ganas de abrir la frontera"
5738,"Hola. No entiendo por qué la molestia, si incluso tuve la gentileza de hacer una mención a u usuario para que estuvieras al tanto de lo que publiqué. 

En realidad no tengo ganas de discutir contigo. Creo que tenemos distintas interpretaciones de la discusión y, sin ánimo de ofender, no creo que estés discutiendo de buena fe. Yo literalmente inicié mi argumento con la siguiente frase:

>... debería Duque, por ejemplo, dejar de pendejear con lo de Maduro y los derechos humanos y abrir la frontera para que se dinamice el comercio con Venezuela... Nada más por ahí tienes cientos de millones de dólares para empezar a cerrar la brecha fiscal. 

Luego mencioné un conjunto de acciones que **yo** considero pudieran ayudar a recaudar fondos distintas a las que aparecían en la reforma tributaria original incluyendo - y esta es una idea enteramente propia, basada en evidencia y que mal pudiera yo endilgársela al Comité del Paro - de legalizar el cannabis e imponer fuertes tributos a su consumo y comercialización. 

Culminé la lista señalando que:

>El Estado tiene herramientas a su disposición para hacer frente a la crisis. 

**Unas herramientas que claramente partieron de mí - /u/Beginning_Beginning - no del Comité del Paro**. ¿Qué carajos iba a saber yo (o cualquiera de nosotros si a ver vamos) cuáles eran esas propuestas en ese momento? Y sin embargo tú empezaste a responder cada uno de **mis** puntos: ""impuesto a las bebidas azucaradas, puede ser, puede que no...""; ""medidas y proyectos en curso para reducir los gastos de funcionamiento del Estado ya hay varias...""; ""lo de impulsar el comercio con Venezuela no tiene sentido..."", y culminaste escribiendo que ""en general no hay razón para que el Gobierno 'conceda' así como así ninguno de esos puntos. Son cosas que requerirían muchísimo más debate y deliberación"".

Seamos serios por favor. ¿Ahora resulta ser tú estabas era respondiendo los puntos del Comité del Paro? ¿De dónde salió eso y cómo alguien podría saberlo?

Tú expusiste las razones por las cuáles lo de impulsar el comercio con Venezuela no tenía sentido, yo expliqué por qué tu razonamiento era errado y tú contra-argumentaste señalando razones adicionales. Es todo parte del mismo hilo de discusión. Estoy al tanto de la frase ""Obvio que yo creo que debe estar abierta"" pero ello no concuerda con la idea de que ""impulsar el comercio con Venezuela no tiene sentido"" cuando yo enlacé no una sino cuatro fuentes de empresarios colombianos solicitando apoyo al ejecutivo a lo largo de un año para que se abriera la frontera y así impulsar el comercio con Venezuela. Ya ahí no había más que responder, tú hiciste un comentario basado en suposiciones personales que no se sostienen a la luz de los hechos (y a la final tuve yo la razón, Duque abrió la frontera). 

Con respecto a lo demás no voy a comentar. Guarda esta conversación y revísala periódicamente cuando veas lo que va a pasar con Guaidó, con las elecciones de alcaldes y gobernadores en Venezuela, con la bajada de tono de las acusaciones de Colombia hacia Venezuela y el cambio de actitud del grupo de Chile, con la mejora del comercio binacional luego de que el gobierno colombiano se vea obligado a negociar de tú a tú con Maduro y se le olvide el gobierno interino y toda el cuento de los derechos humanos (que Colombia también se pasa por el forro).

A la final a los hechos no les importan los comentarios formulados en Reddit por un par de desconocidos."
5739,"Lo ideal dicta que un gobierno debería tomar las mejores decisiones para garantizar el bienestar de los pobladores. 

Una visión más pragmática (más cínica, aunque más ajustada a nuestras realidades) es que un gobierno debería tomar las mejores decisiones que le permitan mantenerse en el poder, lo cual uno esperaría que implique garantizar el bienestar de los pobladores para que estos los vuelvan a votar en las siguientes elecciones.  

La gente que ha leído este post y le ha hecho downvotes quizás no se ha dado cuenta de que, la ineptitud de Duque es porque no ha sabido tomar decisiones adecuadas, por ejemplo en materia de COVID (el bienestar de las personas), pero aún si no le importase el bienestar de las personas, más importante aún es que no ha tomado las decisiones adecuadas que debería haber tomado si quiere mantenerse en el poder. 

Puede que estando la frontera abierta o cerrada con Venezuela sea lo mismo, pero la percepción de la gente vale muchísimo y hay cosas que son indudables: uno, que Cúcuta está vuelta mierda y el cierre de frontera le dio durísmo; dos, que la gente de Cúcuta lleva un año rogándole a Duque porque abra la frontera; tres, que el Norte de Santander es crucial en el plan electoral del Centro Democrático para las elecciones del 2022; cuatro, que el gobierno así lo reconoce y - a pesar de haber dicho lo contrario hace apenas un mes cuando Duque ""definitivamente descartó esta posibilidad"" - le tocó volver a abrir la frontera; cinco, que lo hace desde una posición débil, con una imagen internacional seriamente opacada, pero negándose a negociar con Venezuela y apoyando a un gobierno paralelo venezolano que la Unión Europea dejó de reconocer en enero. 

De paso, está contra el tiempo en bajar las tensiones y reactivar la economía porque aún no ha acabado el paro y mientras tanto está tratando de mejorar la imagen del país y sacar una nueva reforma tributaria que tiene que pasar sí o sí y pronto, porque si no Fitch y Moody's también van a calificar la deuda colombiana como BBB- lo cual sería fatal. Para rematar, estamos en medio de un tercer pico de pandemia que está matando a 500 colombianos todos los días y que de repente obliga otra vez a cerrar los pasos por concepto de cuarentena (con todo y que ya ni nos acordemos). 

Esa es la realidad, yo no entiendo qué es tan difícil de aceptar. Como le dije al otro usuario: guarde este post y veremos cuál va a ser la actitud del gobierno de Duque frente al de Maduro en los meses por venir, vamos a ver cómo evoluciona el conflicto venezolano este año electoral, vamos a ver cómo Guaidó sale como corcho de limonada."

5756,"La parte de la protesta que tu ignoras es que hay al menos 41 muertos por las balas de la policía, al menos 200 desapariciones sin esclarecer, y te concentras en un suceso doloroso que no promovieron los manifestantes."
5757,"Como es ""la parte de la protesta que este sub no quiere ver""?, claramente escuchando el testimonio uno determina que fue la autoridad la que no dejo pasar, ellos son los unicos lanzando explosivos y lacrimogenos, en pocas palabras lo que se ha esta montando en el sub."
5758,La gente se empeña en creer que los manifestantes son seres impolutos. Realmente no creen que esto pasa.
5759,"Ni siquiera fueron los protestantes gran huevón, la bebé murió por haber respirado gases lacrimógenos y la propia policía fué la que disparó a la Ambulancia con las granadas de gas y de aturdimiento."
5760,Por que no hay un buen hospital en buenaventura?
5761,"Tienes toda la razón. La triste realidad es que ya no se le puede creer a nadie. Ningún lado está libre de pecado, cada uno cuenta su mentira y nosotros decidimos que mentira nos gusta mas. Al final del día, no ha cambiado nada. El paro tuvo resultados? Creo que como muchos fue un esfuerzo en vano que trajo más discordia que otra cosa. Los policías también son personas, y no de dinero. Pobres contra pobres, se matan entre sí y nada gana."
5762,"¿Ambos lados? Hay claramente un lado que controla la mayoría de la narrativa. Mencionan a cada rato las víctimas de abuso policial (que no defiendo, obviamente), pero apuñalan a un comandante de la Policía o abusan sexualmente a una uniformada y nadie dice ni mu."
5763,esto es lo que sucede cuando una población carece de acceso a la educación. Empiezan a carecer de la habilidad del pensamiento crítico porque nunca les enseñaron cómo cuestionar todo y pensar objetivamente.
5764,"conforme íbamos pasando empezaron a tirarnos cosas explosivas y gases lacrimógenos"", los manifestantes pues sí podrían tirar explosivos, es cierto, pero no tienen lacrimógenos, si hay lacrimógeno mientras pasa una ambulancia, hay un único culpable"
5765,Los problemas que tiene el país vienen de mucho antes que el centro democrático existiera amigo. Se nota que eres muy joven para decir eso
5766,"¿""siempre""?, no, ya hay varios casos de manifestantes que no dejan pasar ambulancias. Hay un video de un bloqueo en donde no dejan pasar una ambulancia, uno de los idiotas bloqueando la vía les dice que ""busquen otra ruta""... voy a buscarlo."
5767,Eso no es del todo cierto. Habia un video que subieron aqui donde ellos bloquearon un señor con ataque cardiaco y se ve que son los que bloquean. Hay protestantes muy malos tambien que no estan dejando pasar.
5768,"> Los políticos que han gobernado este país son los verdaderos culpables. Estos se descaran cuando salen a decir a pedir que la violencia pare, cuando ellos mismos han creado las condiciones para ella con su negligencia, corrupción e ineptitud. No nos dejemos confundir por favor. Los culpables de estos hechos de muerte y violencia es la clase política.

Ellos son quienes deberían rendir cuentas."
5769,">al menos 41 muertos por las balas de la policía

falso, de esos 41 muertos no todos fueron por balas de la policía. de hecho, dos son policías. Otros fueron asesinato de civiles contra civiles, también hubo una muerte por paro cardiaco, otra por accidente."
5770,"No son los únicos lanzando explosivos...que pena pero eso es de parte y parte. He estado en varias y he visto tanto abuso policial como victimización por parte de los manifestantes...todos los que no son de aquí deberían ver la historia completa. Deberían ver como se meten a robar a los súper mercados, como atacan a gente que no tiene nada que ver y como cobran para poder pasar por las vías...eso también es parte de la protesta y los únicos bastardos animales no son los de la policía..."
5771,"Los insultos nunca llevan a un diálogo constructivo amigo. Te recomiendo bajes los humos, vivirás mas feliz"
5772,"Ojala existiera algun medio que contara las cosas como son pero todos son biased con las cosas. Sigo a varios politicos de derecha-izquierda en twitter y es horrible como manipulan a los jovencitos con mentiras.   Estudie en una Universidad Privada-Publica y vi lo peor de ambos bandos con los profesores. El Conservador Catolico Megauribista y el Commie que Glamorizaba Cuba-El Marxismo.

Yo personalmente creo que el paro fue justo y funciono pero es inhumano no preocuparse victimas de ambos lados y por todas las familias que se fueron a la calle-perdieron todo por esto......tambien si trae crisis economica al pais peor que las reformas entonces cual es el punto???? remedio peor que la enfermedad? aqui ambos lados se estan haciendo los sordos y pueden arruinarnos a todos si siguen con esto. Que busquen soluciones rapido y ya. Duque en que piensa porque tan lento????? A este paso lo que ocurrira es una Guerra Civil o algo porque las personas ya estan cansadas.

Aqui existe una mezcla de cosas. Causas muy justas porque el gobierno tiene muy descuidado todo-Interes politicos de ambos extremos-Covid....un desastre total. No me gusta Santos nada pero al menos en su mandato hubo mas tranquilidad. Bring me back to 2016 hahaha when life was good ⭐

Un abrazo parcero. Esperemos pronto termine todo esto y Colombia pueda aprender-mejorar con esto. Praying for the future of this country."
5773,"De acuerdo, volvemos a repetir la historia, colombianos matando colombianos... hasta cuándo? ☹️"
5774,"> ya no se le puede creer a nadie. Ningún lado está libre de pecado, cada uno cuenta su mentira y nosotros decidimos que mentira nos gusta mas. Al final del día, no ha cambiado nada. 

Y las élites se aprovechan de ello."
5775,"Bueno eso si es cierto en este sub. Falta mucha objetividad aqui y si lo mencionas te tachan de ""tibio"" los violentos. A mi me parece eso terrible. Cuando se habla de los muertos pero se ignora que tambien muchos policias murieron como el que le pegaron las puñaladas que se ve no era mala persona. Yo soy de izquierda pero algunas persona de mi bando a veces me dan miedo."
5776,Totalmente de acuerdo. Todo esto se da por la falta de educacion tan severa que tenemos en Colombia.
5777,"Además de la falta de educación, tampoco sabemos cómo se maneja el país, desconocemos las leyes y la estructura del Estado, así hayamos pasado por la universidad. De esto se valen los políticos y los medios para manipularnos a su antojo."
5778,"Hmmm....cuerto, la policia esta haciendo bastantes cosas incorrectas, yo tambien vi el video donde salen con tv nuevecito, y otras cosas, tambien el del exito donde metieron un poco de gente y a unos los golpearon y a otros los ayudaron a salir...cierto, falta mostrar la historia completa, por cierto, hay que recordar quienes son los que usan gases y flashbangs!"
5779,"> Que busquen soluciones rapido y ya. Duque en que piensa porque tan lento????? A este paso lo que ocurrira es una Guerra Civil o algo porque las personas ya estan cansadas.

Si ambas partes dejaran la intransigencia sería mejor para todos."
5780,También la historia del país y por qué los colombianos siempre han estado peleando entre sí.
5781,"Pero dígame cómo controla uno a un montón de gente que aunque la mayoría está ejerciendo su derecho constitucional a la protesta, hay otros mal intencionados intentando hacer maldades? Pareciera que lo único que les sirve es que los policías les den las pistolas...realmente me parece muy triste que se aprovechen de un reclamo legítimo para hacer lo que les da la gana con los bienes de los demás, olvidamos que si bien la corrupción cuesta mucho al país, esto no ayuda en nada...se quejan por muchos afectados, pero están queriendo hacer pasar a la gente que ha luchado toda la vida para tener un negocio como pérdidas colaterales. Honestamente no es justo con el resto de gente, yo apoyo la movilización, personalmente he ido a varias...pero hasta aquí, he visto como los mismos manifestantes provocan a la policía, he visto que les tiran explosivos improvisados y he visto en primera plana el amarillismo más triste, ofensivo y denigrante. Le recuerdo que el fin no justifica los medios y si así están actuando por una causa,  por justa que sea, su forma de ser entonces no dista mucho del pensamiento del señor Uribe...hay que saber hacer las cosas y honestamente estamos actuando con dolo y estamos culpando al estado por ello...eso es caer muy bajo y personalmente yo me bajo de ese tren"
5782,"Exacto, también eso."
5783,"Voy a hacer algunas reflexiones que no denotan apoyo o rechazo a cierto tipo de protesta sino que busca explicar el por qué el pacifismo da paso a la violencia. Si entendemos las causas reales, eventualmente pudiéramos dar con respuestas efectivas. 

I. Para llegar a tu pregunta deberíamos cuestionarnos primero ¿para qué sirve la protesta? y más concretamente ¿para qué sirve la protesta pacífica y más en un país como Colombia? 

A mí me llama muchísimo la atención cuando la gente, como tú, dice que las personas tienen derecho a protestar de manera individual o colectiva sin afectar a los demás. Pero, honestamente ¿para qué sirve eso en un país como Colombia? ¿En un país donde se pierden 50 billones de pesos al año por concepto de corrupción, irrespetando todos los derechos habidos y por haber (el de la movilización por vías dañadas y puentes caidos, el de la salud y la educación por falta de recursos, etc.) qué va a importar el derecho a la protesta? ¿Un país en dónde el Fiscal General Barbosa acaba de retirar a la fiscal Amparo Ceron, quien llevaba 3 años investigando el caso Odebretch, un día después de que pidiera una reunión con la vicefiscal para informar que iba a llamar a indagatoria a Álvaro Uribe, a Andrés Pastrana y a Luis Carlos Sarmiento Angulo? 

""¡Ay! Apoyemos el derecho de esos ciudadanos a que pierdan su tiempo protestando frente a la Fiscalía General de la Nación de forma pacífica, una protesta que nadie va a ver porque de paso los medios de comunicación se van a limpiar el culo con ella y la van a ignorar por completo"".  

Entonces, acá apoyar la protesta pacífica es básicamente apoyar nada. Yo no digo que haya que apoyar la protesta violenta, pero pudiera uno ser más honesto y eliminar el derecho a la protesta pacífica y ya: nos ahorramos tiempo, esfuerzo y sueños vanos. Porque, además, el gobierno ha demostrado que, aún cuando acepte negociar con los protestantes pacíficos y llegue a acuerdos, estos acuerdos no va a tener intención de cumplirlos, como pasó con los acuerdos a los que se llegaron luego de las protestas de 2019. 


II. Hay una cosa de la que probablemente no estés al tanto, pero distintas estrategias de protesta como mecanismo para lograr cambios políticos y sociales son estudiadas e implementadas a lo largo del mundo y se verifica su efectividad permanentemente. Hace un poco menos de dos décadas comenzaron a suscitarse entre varias de las ex-repúblicas soviéticas un conjunto de movimientos insurgentes más o menos pacíficos (pero todos enarbolando la bandera de la no-violencia) que recibieron en su conjunto el nombre de Revoluciones de Colores. Esas revoluciones estuvieron fuertemente influenciadas por la obra de un tipo de nombre Gene Sharp. En todas estas revoluciones hubo la participación y financiación más o menos directa de organizaciones como USAID, NED, Freedom House, Soros Foundation, IRI, Albert Einstein Institution entre otros. 

Al principio las Revoluciones de Colores tuvieron éxito: en Georgia, Ukrania, Kirguistán, Líbano; pero luego empezaron a fracasar: Armenia, Azerbaiján, Moldavia, Uzbekistán, Bielorrusia, etc. Los gobiernos empezaron a idear formas para contrarrestar estos llamados ""golpes suaves"", en todos los casos con fuertes medidas represivas (viene a la mente Irán) pero en algunos casos a punta de plomo (como pasó en Bahrein). Es desafortunado, pero la protesta pacífica se devaluó aún más cuando se enarboló como mecanismo de cambio político, abrazando las demandas genuinas de la gente pero impulsado por motivos geopolíticos más amplios. 

Después de esto las siguientes revoluciones que vinieron todas han involucrado la fuerza de las armas y la violencia en conjunto con la protesta social: Siria, Irak, ~~Líbano~~ Libia (de hecho, todas las revoluciones de la llamada ""Primavera Árabe""). Acá en Latinoamérica tenemos lo que pasó en Honduras y en Bolivia, dos golpes de Estado que se consumaron sólo porque las fuerzas de seguridad del estado terminaron participando de forma activa en los derrocamientos. 

Entonces, el segundo punto es que, en los actuales momentos, lo que nos enseña la historia contemporánea es que la protesta pacífica se ha venido devaluando y que, por el contrario, la violencia genera mayores réditos. 


III. Lo tercero es que la historia también nos indica que los problemas económicos de la nación debilitan al gobierno, puede que la gente se canse ahorita de los protestantes pero la gente tiene una memoria histórica cortísima y a la final, en unos meses cuando todos los problemas de la contracción económica, la pandemia, etc. la gente va a culpar a Duque de su situación. Es famosa la frase de Richard Nixon a propósito de la situación económica en Chile durante el gobierno de Allende: ""Make the economy scream"" - o sea, que grite la economía. ¿Tú crees que la gente pensaba en Nixon y la CIA cuando subía la inflación a cifras de tres dígitos y la escasez producto de la especulación y el acaparamiento? Pensaban en Allende y su incapacidad por poner orden en el país (más allá de que le resultara imposible). Es precisamente por este motivo que lo primero que hace los EEUU cuando quiere sacudir un gobierno incómodo es poner sanciones económicas que lo debiliten y la gente se obstine, llámese Irán o Cuba o Venezuela. 

El punto es que la protesta que incomoda económicamente tiene más posibilidades de éxito que la que no. 

---

Mi posición es que no debería haber bloqueos ni violencia si existiesen formas correctas y respuestas adecuadas a las demandas de la población. A mí también me afectan los bloqueos y todo lo que ello implica así que mal pudiera yo estar de acuerdo. Sin embargo, entiendo la lógica detrás del por qué algunos civiles terminan cerrando vias y haciendo desmadres. Creo que es el Estado el que tiene la responsabilidad de hallar formas de tender puentes entre los distintos sectores de la sociedad para evitar llegar a estos extremos.

EDIT - Cosa que el Estado no sólo no está haciendo sino lo contrario, busca deslegitimar la propuesta minimizando la manifestación pacífica (masiva) y enfocándose en el bandidaje a la vez que los organismos de seguridad del Estado apelan sistemáticamente a la provocación con el fin de generar más violencia."
5784,"Me atrevo a decir que la gran mayoría de personas que apoyamos las protestas no está a favor de los bloqueos, ni son los que van a realizar actos vandálicos o bloqueos y demás. Estos son una fuerte minoría, con uno que otro policia infiltrado de por medio. La cuestión es que, estas personas también apoyan el paro, entonces todos creamos un estigma interno (ayudado por los medios de *des*información) de como las protestas no son este espacio de indignación, discusión, diversidad cultural y demás, sino que está predominantemente influenciado por los actos vandálicos, teniendo como resultado que la creencia de muchos que salir a protestar es apoyar dichos actos, y para algunos círculos más extremistas, incluso es sinónimo de ser vándalo o terrorista (!).

Yo personalmente lo apoyo, pero me entristece ver cosas como las historias de las personas que se han precarizado sus condiciones laborales, cuando queman un negocio pequeño, cuando asesinan a un policia, etc, pero aún más tristeza y rabia me genera ver a un  Estado garantizador de derechos quitar ojos e incluso asesinar a civiles, historias de personas que no pueden  acceder a un hospital, a sus pensiones, a una educación, o como se roban billones al año en corrupción (no apoyo los actos vandálicos, pero veo pertinente aclarar que este valor supera en varios ordenes de magnitud los gastos por reparación a la propiedad pública)."
5785,"Nadie apoya el vandalismo, pero es que solo a Duque se le ocurre meter más impuestos en plena pandemia y persuadir a la fuerza pública a usar la fuerza en contra de los ciudadanos.

Si los indígenas se sintieran escuchados no requerirían vías de hecho para salir en las noticias. Si ellos taponan las vías es porque el gobierno les hizo promesas de campaña y luego ni los vuelve a mirar. Los canales oficiales ya los agotaron hace rato.

Al gobierno simplemente no le da la gana mandar al presidente o a un ministro a negociar con el movimiento (no con la ""oposición"" de tibios que se inventaron), los delfines no se mezclan con la plebe.

Con dos visitas, con dar garantías así fuera a medias, se terminaban los bloqueos. Pero no les da la puta gana."
5786,"Creo que con los bloqueos y el vandalismo, los promotores del paro están empeorando las cosas.

Si van a presionar al gobierno, háganlo con inteligencia. Si van a hacer bloqueos, háganlos en edificios del gobierno, sedes de grandes compañías, sedes de partidos políticos, sedes de grandes medios de comunicación y casas de los ricos y los políticos.

La gracia es que se incomode a las élites políticas y económicas, **no a la ciudadanía del común**."
5787,"Yo siento que los Bloqueos en las carreteras desesperaron a la people y eso le quito poder a la Marcha. Aqui en mi barrio apoyaban eso y cuando vieron que ya no habia comida ahi se fueron contra los que marchan.  Se habria sostenido mas esto si hubiera sido solo en las ciudades. No estoy de acuerdo cuando las marchas se concentran en un solo lugar de la ciudad porque afectan a los negocios aleñados  como ocurrio en ibague. Deben moverse por distintos lugares. Tambien las marchas deberian concentrarse en los lugares donde viven los Politicos y miembros del gobierno. Porque no desesperar a los Politicos desde sus residencias? Vayan a los barrios mas ricos donde viven los congresistas y denles un susto. Ahi si se hacen las cosas.

Contra los bloqueos estoy totalmente en contra porque afecta mas de lo que ayuda. Aqui puse varios posts de lo malo que es para las personas que no tienen nada. Afecta a Campesinos y millones de negocios pequeños de toda indole. Se arma presion pero la s repercusiones economicas son peores. Aunque tambien esta justificado porque el gobierno en serio tiene muy abandonados a los Camioneros. Ya son muy pasados. Es tan solo ver los peajes tan caros que les ponen.

Contra el vandalismo no estoy de acuerdo pero pues eso pasa en todas las marchas worldwide. Creo tiene validez eso de que a veces es la unica forma que los gobiernos pongan atencion. Si hacen marchas pacificas al gobierno le vale \*\*\* asi de malos son los politicos, A ellos no le importa discutir pacificamente. Tristemente las personas se ven afectadas y eso tambien me parece fatal. Es una encrucijada contra la pared."
5788,"Los apoyo? No

Pero entiendo que las protestas pacíficas simplemente no nos van a llevar a nada, especialmente con la manada de corruptos que nos gobiernan."
5789,"...los bienes fisicos (edificios y demas) tienen seguros, de eso estoy muy seguro, por eso cuando dicen que los costos son, yeah, ya se que es propaganda..."
5790,"Las vías de hecho no son lo mejor en mi opinión, pero en cierto modo transmiten un mensaje diferente al de la propia protesta pacífica y deben ser entendidad en su contexto. 

De lo que estoy seguro, descartando la posibilidad de infiltrados, es que quien daña la propiedad privada o realiza bloqueos se siente agredido e ignorado por la sociedad en su conjunto, y esa cólera almacenada la expulsa de esa forma no sólo para hacerse notar sino para decir ""acá nadie se salva, ni ustedes"". Como tratando de meter la empatia por las malas al meter a los demás en su situación de precariedad (ojo, es mi hipótesis)"
5791,"Las protestas en pocas palabras, son una minoría imponiendo sus ideales sobre la mayoría. En este caso la mayoría voto por duque, y solo algo como 2 millones de personas están protestando, en su mayoría estudiantes sin experiencia laboral, económica o de vida. 

Para los que digan que es un movimiento masivo, si puede que lo sea, pero sigue siendo una minoría del país de 45 millones. 

Se ven mucho énfasis en los avisos policiales, que lastimosamente han habido, pero no se habla de la mayoría de protestas, con presencia de policía y ESMAD, que terminan sin altercados. Hablan de los policías que se pasan, pero no hablan de los daños a infraestructura que se han realizado por parte de los protestantes, no hablan de las pérdidas económicas en los privados que simplemente no pueden trabajar, dónde quedan sus derechos entonces?, Dónde quedó el derecho al trabajo de las personas que han sido despedidas por causa del paro? Considerando que cualquier ciudadano puede hacer una propuesta de ley, porque los líderes del paro no lo han hecho?

Hay acusaciones de que el gobierno quiere desacreditar el paro, pero todos los medios estatales ( teleantioquia, Canal 1, CityTv etcétera) están enfocados en remarcar las protestas pacíficas. Son los privados los que los desacreditan, porque no nos conviene, el paro genera perdidas económicas irreparables, hace más difícil importar o exportar, la calificación de riesgo del país se va a la mierda, lo que implica que no hay inversión extragera, es decir menos empleo, para los mismos que están protestando. 

Para empeorar, la ráfaga de falsa información en redes están jodiendo más toda la situación, ya ni siquiera saben porque están protestando. Va a pasar lo de siempre, el gobierno les dice que si a todo, y en dos años no cumple nada, porque su intención era detener el paro, no realizar una mejora de las situación del país. 

En conclusión, la protesta es por mucho la peor forma de participación ciudadana, es propensa a la intervención de mal intencionados, genera efectos secundarios severos y violenta los derechos de personas que no tienen interés en el tema. Si alguien quiere contradecir esto, por favor que mencioné otra forma de participación peor."

El problema es que el estado solo escucha a los ricos, los militares y las élites políticas y sociales. Si se lograra convencer a esa gente, el estado tal vez escuche."
5793,Pero como afectar a todo el pueblo bloqueando vías y no centrarse en los políticos va a ayudar a que se reduzca la corrupción?
5794,"Apoyo lo que dices pero voy un poco más allá.... todos los Tombos son unos hps y hay mucho bruto suelto defendiendo a los corruptos.

Los chinos de las primeras líneas son unos duros y tiene más huevos y ovarios que cualquiera. 

Es hora de que el pueblo despierte y pare de alimentar políticos zánganos que lo único que hacen es dividir el país para aprovechar y robarse lo que más pueden."
5795,"La mayoría ni salió a votar por Duque, ni petro y ni por el voto en blanco."
5796,">  Si se lograra convencer a esa gente, el estado tal vez escuche.
 
¿A los ricos, los militares y las élites políticas y sociales? ¿Cómo los vas a convencer? Se supone que son ellos los que tienen mejor educación, mejores oportunidades y no están tan agobiados por las vicisitudes. De hecho, esas élites se auto-denominan ""gente de bien"" (que por descarte significa que los que no piensen igual son ""gente de mal"" o algo así). 

Uno esperaría que las élites asumieran la responsabilidad de enderezar el país pero, desafortunadamente, el puesto se lo reparten entre los ultra snobs que aún creen que estamos en el Virreinato de Nueva Granada, los caporales que piensan que todo esto es una finca, los camanduleros y rezanderos de oficio y todos los recién vestidos que se han beneficiado de la cultura traqueta. 

Volvemos a lo mismo, no es culpa de la gente del común que el Estado no escuche la protesta pacífica. El Estado es el culpable, es precisamente su actuación la que propicia la degeneración de la protesta. 

Pues ya que el Estado no tiene intenciones de cambiar pues yo me resigné que a seguirán habiendo bloqueos y vandalismo, que es la evolución natural del conflicto ¿Qué se le va a hacer?"
5797,"Eso crea más descontento, y en términos generales es descontento con los políticos. En sí lo único que hace es meterles presión y les da un poco de temor en que la violencia escale en contra de ellos y sus bienes.

Además centrarse en la política no es un caso viable en nuestra actualidad, un ejemplo reciente es el plebiscito anti corrupción y votación por la paz."

5799,">armamento de guerra que se debía usar para acabar el conflicto armado.

Acabar la guerra con armamento no letal, gases de humo y aturdidoras? El OP nos acaba la guerra en 3 meses y de paso recupera Panama

Te digo mi opinión, la guerra ideológica acabó hace bastante años siendo generosos, acabó en el tratado de Paz, lo que hay ahora es una guerra contra las drogas y narcotraficantes que se escudan diciendo que luchan por cierta ideologia, y que es lo que pasa, que la guerra contra las drogas la perdimos cuando nos dimos cuenta que matar a los capos no sirvió para nada, y que para rematar no se combate el problema de raíz. 

Si el gobierno no invierte en infraestructura en el campo, vías, acceso, salud, educación, oportunidades laborales, los cultivos solo irán en aumento y de igual forma las ganancias de los narcos. Y eso es lo que ningún gobierno ha hecho. 

No digo que no hay que utilizar al ejercito, hay que seguir usandolo e invertir más en el, porque gente peligrosa siempre va a existir, pero el problema de las drogas va mucho más de combatirla con armas."

> Si el gobierno no invierte en infraestructura en el campo, vías, acceso, salud, educación, oportunidades laborales, los cultivos solo irán en aumento y de igual forma las ganancias de los narcos. Y eso es lo que ningún gobierno ha hecho.

Todo eso se resume en un concepto basico: falta de sentido comun. La gente es capaz de llegar a extremos para probar q su punto es el correcto, para mostrar q no se equivocaron, y es esa fuerza pujante de extremo y extremo que acaba siempre en violencia y muertes.

Ahora yo si menciono un punto adicional, la solucion en un mundo ideal seria quedarse en el medio, un punto equilibrado donde tanto ideas liberales como ideas conservadoras puedan vivir armoniosamente. Lastimosamente, siempre habra gente queriendo extremar la balanza, y la unica forma de contrarrestar ese ataque, es actuando de la misma manera en el otro lado. Extrañamente la mejor forma de mantener un equilibrio, es precisamente parandose en un extremo."
5813,"Muy buena reflexión.

Es que si no piensas en un extremo estás en contra de ambos polos."
5814,"Estoy de acuerdo con usted. Si no cuestionamos y reflexionamos, nos domina una sociedad que solo busca que una mitad destruya la otra mitad."
5815,"Ni siquiera es protestar por derecho, sino cuando se usan las protestas y los clamores populares justificados para impulsar una narrativa especifica y hacer exigencias no apegadas a la realidad por el grado de imposibilidad para ser cumplidas a cabalidad.

Hay muchas cosas que suponen un problema en lo que propone el mal llamado comite del paro, con algunas propuestas siendo, de entrada, francamente incumplibles (irrealizables). El ejemplo mas obvio es la peticion de ""no discriminacion por genero, diversidad sexual y etnica"" . ¿Como planean hacer que eso se cumpla?, ¿acaso quieren que se encarcele a cualquier ciudadano que exhiba alguna conducta discriminatoria contra alguno de los grupos en cuestion hasta que la gente sienta miedo o algo asi?. Por mas educacion que haya al respecto o castigo al irrespeto a dichas normas, siempre va a haber alguien que rechace cualquier codigo implementado para proteger a esos grupos y exhiba esas conductas de una u otra forma y en cualquier escenario. El gobierno podria hacer de su parte dentro de las instituciones que lo componen pero, ¿como se asegura el cumplimiento por parte de la sociedad?

Otra cosa en el mismo sentido es que quieren mayores beneficios sociales pero, ¿como esperan que se paguen si no quieren asumir mas cargas tributarias?. Si, ya hemos oido a Petro, a Wilson Arias y compañia hablando de que se le cobre mas impuestos al sector financiero y los grandes capitales y eso esta bien, pero hay un limite porque, de lo contrario, esa gente simplemente va a recoger la plata que maneja y se va a ir a otro lado con ella. Tambien hay discusiones sobre combatir la evasion fiscal y la corrupcion pero los resultados en estos frentes no se verian de la noche a la mañana. Fuera de eso, Petruchis y compañia hablan de otros mecanismos de financiacion como imprimir dinero, prestamos del Banco de la Republica y reversa a beneficios tributarios para algunos grupos; sin embargo, ¿es suficiente dinero para todo?, ¿son fiables los mecanismos destinados a la recaudacion de ese dinero? o ¿está garantizada su fiabilidad en el tiempo?.

Los impuestos son necesarios y debe haber mayor equidad en la asignacion de la carga tributaria en el sentido de que cada quien tiene que pagar de acuerdo a sus capacidades, pero no puede hablarse de menos impuestos para un gasto publico cada vez mayor.

Tambien esta el tema de la legitimacion del vandalismo, el terrorismo antiestatal  y anticiudadano y de quienes cometen estos actos al equipararlos con los que salen pacificamente a protestar, mientras se deslegitima el actuar de la fuerza publica de forma generalizada, por parte de elementos involucrados en este paro. Hemos visto como incluso pseudodefensores de derechos humanos como Ariel Avila legitiman el vandalismo de grupos de jovenes al decir que es una respuesta a la violencia del estado, cuando se ha visto que esas conductas antisociales son premeditadas y organizadas."
5816,"Que gran thread. Asi es. Las personas siguen la politica como si fuera una religion. El sentido comun se ha perdido. Ya las personas no son capaces de tener conversaciones. Solo odio y peleas de un bando a otro que no resuelven nada y crean un loop de destruccion infinito. Nadie es capaz de dar puntos con objetividad-sin biases porque tienen que ser fiel a su partido asi haga las cosas mal.

>la revolución molecular, complot comunista de Venezuela 

Esto no tiene nada que ver con la derecha ni la izquierda. No es una opinión económica ni política. Es una noticia que varias personas creen y unos no. Claro que cada uno tiene sus propios razones para protestar


>¿Van a seguir sobre dimensionando el ""daño"" que le hacen las protestas al país y minimizando los abusos cometidos desde las instituciones que se supone tienen mayor poder sobre nosotros?

No, el daño es real. Que dicen los manifestantes es que hay cosas mucho mas importante. Es la idea de hacer alguien dolor para entender como se siente. No para justificar el daño hecho, para aclaración de que opinan.

>cualquiera que esta a favor de una protesta es un comunista de mierda

Los manifestantes no están exigiendo comunismo, entonces cualquier persona que dice eso lo dice para asustar el pueblo 


>defiende el capitalismo es un facho represor?

Defender el capitalismo también es algo que quieren los manifestantes 


Por todo el resto estoy totalmente de acuerdo. Y nada de lo anterior que mencioné sea tan importante.

te dejo una frase de un filosofo chino:

&#x200B;

“El camino perfecto sólo es difícil para los que eligen,  
no gustes ni disgustes y todo estará claro.  
Si quieres la verdad clara frente a ti, nunca estés a favor o en contra.  
El conflicto entre a favor y en contra es la peor enfermedad de la mente.”  
Jianzhi Sengcan - Siglo V D.C."
5833,"> El ejemplo mas obvio es la peticion de ""no discriminacion por genero, diversidad sexual y etnica"" . 

Nadie espera que el Estado pueda garantizar, por ejemplo, el derecho a la vida en un 100% de la población (sería una belleza que en un país como Colombia hubiese cero homicidios), eso no impide que esté planteado en las leyes y los programas de gobierno (y sus actuaciones) al menos como un *desideratum*. 

>pero hay un limite porque, de lo contrario, esa gente simplemente va a recoger la plata que manejan y se va a ir a otro lado con ella. 

Lo hermoso del concepto de libre mercado es que, si existe demanda de algo (por ejemplo de servicios financieros) el sistema incentiva el que otros ofrezcan sus servicios y así obtengan ganancias (por el cuento de la racionalidad de los entes económicos). La banca es tan buen negocio que, te lo aseguro, si se van esos que dices vendrán otros a ocupar su lugar. 

>¿es suficiente dinero para todo?, ¿son fiables los mecanismos destinados a la recaudacion de ese dinero? o ¿está garantizada su fiabilidad en el tiempo?

Pues lo mismo pudiera decirse de las medidas que había planteado anteriormente el gobierno. Duque pretendía que alguien estrato cuatro (la clase media) pagase 19% de más en sus cuentas de servicios, empezase a declarar renta (porque uno esperaría que ganase más de 1.6MM de pesos al año), empezase a pagar IVA por todos esos otros rubros que antes estaban exentos y, de paso, encajase la inflación que iba a venir cuando todos los productos subiesen de precio por razones obvias y todo lo demás que dejé por fuera. ¿Cuántos de esos estrato cuatro iban a quedar luego en el estrato tres? ¿En dónde crees tú que igual van a recaer los impuestos cuando se amplíe aún más la inequidad económica (de la que Colombia está en el top 5 del mundo) y quede un país sólo de pobres y ultra ricos?

Igual hay muchas otras estrategias de recaudación que van más allá de lo que estás planteando. Hay mucho dinero en Colombia pero, desafortunadamente, muy mal distribuido."
5834,">Ni siquiera es protestar por derecho, sino cuando se usan las protestas y los clamores populares justificados para impulsar una narrativa especifica y hacer exigencias no apegadas a la realidad por el grado de imposibilidad para ser cumplidas a cabalidad.

¿De donde sacas que no es por derecho? creo que entiendo lo que decís con la narrativa especifica, pero creo que igual es parte de una democracia que suficiente cantidad de personas se pongan de acuerdo para hacer un reclamo. No creo que se trate de ""manipulación"" de la opinión pública, en todo caso eso lo ejercen los medios tradicionales.


>  El ejemplo mas obvio es la peticion de ""no discriminacion por genero, diversidad sexual y etnica"" . ¿Como planean hacer que eso se cumpla?, ¿acaso quieren que se encarcele a cualquier ciudadano que exhiba alguna conducta discriminatoria contra alguno de los grupos en cuestion hasta que la gente sienta miedo o algo asi?.

La propuesta debe estar mejor formulada que esto. si tenés algún documento que comente cual sería el procedimiento sería muy instructivo, porque estaríamos suponiendo sobre la nada. 

> Otra cosa en el mismo sentido es que quieren mayores beneficios sociales pero, ¿Cómo esperan que se paguen si no quieren asumir mas cargas tributarias?.

Las financiaciones estatales se pueden hacer de muchas formas, en este momento igual ya hay una carga impositiva sobre las grandes empresas, pero hay muchísimo despilfarre gubernamental y súmale a eso la corrupción, creo que esta clarísimo que el estado podría recaudar más y gastar menos habiendo tantos mecanismos y formas de hacerlo sin perjudicar tanto a las clases media y baja. No pensar en todas estas variables es un error grave.


> Tambien esta el tema de la legitimacion del vandalismo, el terrorismo antiestatal  y anticiudadano y de quienes cometen estos actos al equipararlos con los que salen pacificamente a protestar, mientras se deslegitima el actuar de la fuerza publica de forma generalizada, por parte de elementos involucrados en este paro. Hemos visto como incluso pseudodefensores de derechos humanos como Ariel Avila legitiman el vandalismo de grupos de jovenes al decir que es una respuesta a la violencia del estado, cuando se ha visto que esas conductas antisociales son premeditadas y organizadas.

Deslegitimar el acto de la fuerza publica no es legitimar el vandalismo, hace la cuenta respecto a cuantos policías / manifestantes muertos hay y es un dato más que completo para hacerte entender la gravedad de la situación, sumando a esto desapariciones forzadas, violaciones y heridos. 

Si seguimos hablando de ""terrorismo vandálico antiestatal"" estamos cayendo en la retórica paranoide de la ultra derecha."

Vandalismo? y si, debe haber, pero realmente, ¿cuantos son en comparación a los que protestan pacificamente? porque esos casos de protesta pacifica que deben ser la mayoría no salen en los medios porque no llaman la atención.

Lo del zurdo radical lo digo porque lo escuche de más de una persona de izquierda, el mismo discurso de un fascista ""hay que matarlos a todos"" ""hay que pasarlos por las armas"" ""hay que limpiar el país"". El fascismo extermina personas de forma sistemática y por definición es autoritario. Hay una frase que dice ""El camino al infierno esta lleno de buenas intenciones"", seguro hubo más de un dictador que pensaba que lo que hacía era correcto, pero eso también te habla de cómo la ideología te puede desconectar de la realidad."

Lo malo es la excesiva feudizacion de nuestro pais: en Colombia el que no le gusta el partido se abre y funda otro mini partido suficiente para sumarla a la coalicion de turno aunque incapaz de representar el sentir ciudadano:

* Uribe no queria que lo mandara Gaviria y armo el CD.
* Unos liberales no querian a Gaviria tampoco y fundaron cambio radical (y Lleras se lo trago).
* Otros liberales no querian a gaviria y se abrieron y fundaron el partido de la U
* Robledo no queria el Polo y se fundo Dignidad.
* Petro tampoco queria que el polo lo manejara y armo la Colombia Humana
* Los verdes son un revuelto el berraco.
* Mira son pastores, esos son rancho aparte de por si.

(Solo liste los representativos)

Es decir, tenemos partidos de sobra pana. El problema es que salvo el tradicional liberal y conservador, todos los demas han sido caudillos que no querian negociar con nadie sino mandar en su propio chuzo. No hay voluntad real de negociar. Ese cacicazgo es muy berraco de manejar.

Si negociar entre dos era berraco te imaginas ahora ? 

Como dato curioso: Israel es otro pais similar a Colombia en ese aspecto: regueros de partiditos, eso es un gallo armar un gobierno alla (democracia parlamentaria) por razones similares.

5851,"Los sistemas tienen que ir cambiando. En lo personal opino que una meritocracia vigilada es mucho mejor que el sistema de roscas y favores políticos que se ha ido desplazando.

Así como tambien pienso que a veces se carga mucho al estado de procesos de control en algunos casos más pesados y costosos que el mismo gasto que se intenta realizar.

Un ejemplo, relevante para Colombia, es el debate sobre la financiación y control de la policía en Estados Unidos, donde hay una posición extrema que quiere abolir la institución de la policía y otra que quiere una policía militarizada. Son esos extremos los que ayudan a los votantes a definir su posición. Sin esos extremos, probablemente no habría debate acerca de la razón de ser de la policía y todos aceptaríamos el estado actual de las cosas sin cuestionamientos."

El sale, ah pero estaban bloqueando. Y ellos también estaban armados.

Aquí el hecho a repudiar fue el hecho que les dispararon civiles, y la policía no hizo nada. El sale a detallas que estaban bloqueando o que también estaban armados que se metieron a un conjunto.

El caso reciente de la menor de edad que se suicidó después de que denunciará abusos de la policía.

Ahh no es que ella nunca piso instalaciones de la policía porque la uri no es de la policía sino de la fiscalía.

Para el nada paso a menos de que pasen un vídeo mostrando el acto mismo. Y aún así me preguntó con que argumentos saldría para refutarlo? Va a salir que es un montaje? Un deep fake? Ah no es que no se sabe que pasó justo antes del video.

El abusa del concepto de duda razonable más allá para seguir tapandose los ojos de que aquí no pasa nada. que a pesar de una lista ya interminable de incoherencias que están pasando en el país. 
Para el es más importante tener la absoluta seguridad de que no hay una duda alguna. Y la duda es más importante que pensar ""Hay hay algo mal aquí"".

Y esto les cae a todos, a Uribe, a Petro, a benedetti, a Robledo, al mismo Fajardo (aunque seamos sinceros le quedaba muy duro elegir con quien irse - todos eran y son demasiado politiqueros).

No es facil papi. El problema no es Duque presidente, son los congresistas (aunque Duque paga la primiparada, el man le falta experiencia y nunca obtuvo nivel de ser un verdadero presidente). 

En vez de bloquear las ciudades, deberiamos esperar que el congreso este en sesion y rodear el congreso y protestar alli hasta que arreglen esta vaina. Ellos son los que siempre han tenido el verdadero poder.  (pero no se me haria raro que el congreso tuviera tuneles)"

Estoy de acuerdo en que debe haber una más eficiente, pero si lo van a hacer, tienen derecho a hacerlo."

El hecho que no tengan suficiente visibilidad es cierto pero no los autoriza. Honestamente no veo diferencia entre ""bloquean porque no los escuchan""  y ""robaba porque tenia hambre"".

Cada dia que pasa el bloqueo se polariza mas la situacion. Ya algunos se radicalizaron y ya hay muertos y heridos porque la poblacion civil se levanto. Si los bloqueos no se controlan simple y llanamente vamos a guerra civil (aunque aun falta bastante). Ya tenemos muy mala experiencia con los grupos paramilitares, lo que menos necesitamos es que un grupo se tome el ""derecho"" de violentar a otros y grupos de empresarios se reunan y decidan financiar a otros grupos de defensa.

Antes teniamos un grupo que se sentia oprimido (violentado olvidado, etc). Ahora tenemos ADICIONALMENTE un grupo que se siente oprimido por otro y por la inaccion del ejecutivo. Como crees que va a ser la proxima vez que haya convocatoria a paro ? consideras de verdad que los ciudadanos van a quedarse callados viendo como se prepara una nueva destruccion del mobiliario urbano y se preparan bloqueos ? es una linea muy, muy peligrosa la que estamos trazando.
 
Cual crees que va a ser la linea principal de los candidatos a elecciones ? los candidatos los elige el pueblo por ser masa (manipulada o no) pero el ejecutivo gobierna con la clase alta porque en el sistema capitalista si las empresas no colaboran se cae el sistema. Entonces ... necesitan de parte y parte y en mi opinion, en general (no todos) las acciones del ejecutivo estan causando resentimiento y desconfianza, mas aun, en las clases media y alta.

Esto es indiscutible y no podría estar más de acuerdo, de hecho, si hubiera más clase media y alta recaudarían muchísimo más y se evitarían todo este lío. Pero las protestas son justamente porque no hay forma de escalar. En Colombia se necesitan entre 5 y 9 generaciones para salir de la pobreza, ¿y cómo van a reclamar los pobres? ¿votando y participando del mismo sistema que los margina? 

No te digo que no entiendo tu punto. Tu punto es claro, no hay necesidad de vandalizar y frenar la economía del país.
Pero esos actos los perpetua en su mayoría gente radical, gente radical que existe por proposiciones como ""no tienen derecho a protestar"" ""son todos vandalos"" ""son todos ratas y guerrilleros"" lo único que hacen esas declaraciones son echar más leña al fuego. ¿Querés que dejen de cortar las rutas y romper negocios? Habría que escuchar que tienen para decir. Pero en vez de eso le disparan incluso a gente que no esta participando de estos actos vandálicos que justamente existen porque no los escuchan.

Es peligroso pensar de una manera tan tajante respecto a los derechos de los demás, porque crea esta generalización para desacreditar marchas por culpa de un porcentaje pequeño de gente resentida y enojada (y con razón) porque si estuvieras en su lugar nunca dirías algo como ""se están extralimitando""."
5877,"De acuerdo. Lo que quiero resaltar es que en mi opinion, la situacion es menos buena hoy en general. 

Si la protesta no hubiera vandalizado las ciudades, si el MIO en cali no hubiera sido quemado, si las ciudades no estuvieran bloqueadas, me atrevo a decir que hoy habria mas apoyo general a la protesta. Casi todos los colombianos la apoyamos pero cuando empezo el vandalismo, la violencia y los bloqueos, el apoyo popular se disminuyo. Hay grupos que la apoyan claro, pero anda a Cali y pregunta hoy como se siente con el paro y como se sentian hace dos semanas y va a ser una gran diferencia.

Perdieron las ciudades que tienen mobiliario urbano destruido. Perdieron los empresarios que no pueden sacar sus productos, perdio el pueblo que se quedo sin empleo y sin transporte. Lo peor ? el pueblo no tiene plan b mientras las clases medias les duele pero pueden pagar comida al doble de precio.

Manana negocian, los dirigentes del paro se vuelven parte del ejecutivo, reciben su tajada y el pueblo quedo endeudado, las ciudades destruidas y la clases media y altas quedaron dolidas y resentidas. No vamos a ganar nada asi, en total vamos a perder mas.

Respondo tu pregunta que sospecho es sarcastica: si, los pobres (y los ricos) reclaman VOTANDO. Haciendo uso del poder mas bravo que existe que es ese voto. Pero me atrevo a jurar que al menos el 50% (yo creeria que mas) no votaron ni votaran para marzo 2022. Esa accion vale mucho (ha sido la base de varias guerras desde el feudalismo, la colonia, etc.) pero si venden su consciencia ... no se puede hacer mucho, tenemos el pais que nos merecemos.

Ivan Ospina, alcalde de Cali no es santo de mi devocion pero hay que reconocerle algo: ha hecho todo lo posible, demasiado en opinion de muchos, para escuchar los miembros del paro. Y solo ha recibido maltrato, amenazas e injurias. Los miembros del paro timidamente dicen que no apoyan la violencia. Repito, TIMIDAMENTE. Apoyan los bloqueos de la economia bajo lo que se podria entender como una mentalidad: ""que se jodan todos, que sufran lo que sufrimos, no se que somos pobres y nadie nos oye ?""

Un pais no lo vamos a construir con esos pensamientos, al menos no uno bueno."

Su construcción representa una maniobra típica de los gobiernos de corte autoritario: preparar un gran teatro gastando una plata considerable para inaugurar un monumento nacionalista mientras en el campo los militares cagan a tiros a campesinos que protestaban. Se construyó en el contexto de La Violencia y del surgimiento de las Farc, del envío de soldados colombianos sin motivo alguno a morir en la Guerra de Correa.

Un monumento fascista no te dice: ""Viva el fascismo"". Un monumento fascista celebra el nacionalismo militar, como Mussolini celebraba al Imperio romano para crear un sustento histórico artificial de su movimiento. Todo eso mientras se desvía la atención de otras cosas que podía hacer el gobierno o, lo que es lo mismo, mientras se le lava el cerebro a la gente para hacerles creer que lo que están haciendo sus gobernantes (inaugurar monumentos, matar campesinos, enviar soldados inocentes a Corea) es un deber patriótico."

5889,"Creo que toca aprender a leer antes. No le dije fascista a Duque, le dije fascista al monumento.

Y es fascista porque Laureano Gómez, presidente nazi que tuvimos, se lo comisionó a un artista italiano que trabajó para Mussolini y era seguidor de él. El monumento es literalmente fascista. Saludos."
5890,"no ni a palos, es peor, porque por lo menos en ese tiempo la gente lo podía percibir, ahora no."
5891,"Laureano Gómez le comisionó ese monumento a un fascista italiano simpatizante de Mussolini que había inmigrado a Colombia, se llamaba Angiolo Mazzoni.

El que lo mandó hacer y el que lo ejecutó eran efectivamente fascistas."

5894,"Osea el monumento que fue diseñado por el presidente para honorar a los soldados que fueron a Corea para batallar a los COMUNISTAS es fascista.... Pero después nunca fue construido porq si no me equivoco lo tumbó Pinilla y lo cambio a algo más ""modesto"" .... que igual fue por la independencia de Colombia.... Aún no veo que tiene de ""fascista"" este monumento. Excepto quien lo construyó era fascista.... si todo lo que representa es muy Anti fascista.... Lo único que te haces base es que fue diseñado por un fascista osea que el sentimiento y todo es fascista... Ahh claro....."
5895,"Ajá y qué? El simbolismo del monumento que representa no tiene nada que ver con el facismo ni con la creencia del artista. Es decir que si el man que le puso las letras es nazi, el man que puso la base de cemento es soviético, y el que hizo el molde de las estatuas es antisemita, entonces el monumento es facista-nazi-comunista-antisemita? No tiene sentido..."

5900,"Exactamente, pero que se hace con alguien que no quiere salir de sus mente hueca."
5901,"Es un monumento nacionalista en la década de 1940 hecho por un conservador con nexos al falangismo, nazismo y fascismo. La arquitectura (el diseño como tal, ya separándolo del escultor) también se llama fascista, de manera que artísticamente también tiene ese adjetivo. No sabía que les preocupara tanto jaja.

>Es decir que si el man que le puso las letras es nazi, el man que puso la base de cemento es soviético, y el que hizo el molde de las estatuas es antisemita, entonces el monumento es facista-nazi-comunista-antisemita?

Eso es un hombre de paja porque yo no estoy hablando de los constructores, estoy hablando de los autores intelectuales de la obra. Los que se sentaron a decidir que debía haber un monumento nacionalista en pleno período de resurgimiento del nacionalismo, y luego decidir que el indicado para hacer eso debía ser alguien que trabajó para uno de los mayores nacionalistas entonces. No nos hagamos los bobos.

Solo estoy describiendo una obra (contextualizándola en la historia y en su movimiento artístico) y lo que pasó ahí ayer; esa foto me pareció una ironía y cierto triunfo, al menos cultural, contra unos dirigentes tradicionalmente conservadores. No estoy diciendo que lo tengan que tumbar ni estoy haciendo juicios de valor, de ninguna manera se puede insinuar por mi post, estoy DESCRIBIENDO. Cómo les duele, por Dios."
5902,"El escarabajo es un vehículo famosamente nazi, sí. ¿Y?"
5903,"Es un error de apreciación totalmente el suyo.

1. Piensa que hice un juicio de valor cuando no fue así
2. Utilicé un adjetivo para calificar una obra que histórica, política y hasta artísticamente se puede describir como ""fascista"". Si no les gusta que se defina histórica o políticamente como fascista (sabrá Dios por qué no, además de ese afán petulante de corregir a anónimos en internet porque dudo que estén en contra de las reuniones en Los Héroes) entonces deben aceptar, por lo menos, que artísticamente sí tiene ese adjetivo.
3. Por alguna razón todos los que empezaron a responder creen que como yo llamé ""fascista"" al monumento entonces yo defiendo no volverlo a usar o demolerlo o algo por el estilo, poniendo un montón de falsas equivalencias y más falacias para contradecir cosas que yo no dije y haciendo mucha gimnasia mental para interpretar siete palabras que escribí. ¿Qué tenía que ver que la Fanta o el Escarabajo, o las Autobahn o el Estadio de Berlín sean creaciones nazis? En ningún momento dije que no se deban usar, de hecho me parece un triunfo de la historia el hecho que gente contraria a las ideas nazistas o fascistas son las que utilizan la Autobahn y ocupan el Estadio de Berlín.

Si solo son capaces de ver simbolismo en el Muro de Berlín o en la Esvástica pues les falta mil capas más de profundidad para cavar. Al fin y al cabo a este país le falta eso: simbolismo, identidad, pero identidad en la lucha sobre todo. Normalizamos tanto las matanzas y los gobiernos conservadores amigos del autoritarismo que se les hace escandaloso cuando uno adjetiva de fascista un monumento público nacionalista ordenado por el gobierno durante La Violencia, como si el hecho de que la construcción del mayor monumento de Bogotá no implicara cierto performance teatral (con todo lo que una inauguración de esas implica en los medios) para cubrir cómo se trataba a los campesinos, al propio estilo dictatorial.

Por cierto, si no logran ver las similitudes entre el Monumento a los Héroes y la [EUR en Roma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EUR,_Rome#Architecture) pues tienen tanta miopía mental que no solo les nubló la ideología sino que les afectó la vista.

>La estructura construye un marco simétrico sobre el eje central del monumento, de modo que exterioriza los criterios geométricos que esconde, reconocibles entre otros aspectos por la monumentalidad de la escalera central, la proporción, la carencia de vanos perimetrales y la sensación de hermetismo de una pieza fundidas completa en concreto reforzado **y que se erige con unos de los pocos vestigios que existen en Colombia de una arquitectura emparentada con la ideología fascista.**

5906,"No era mejor escribir ""Monumento a los Héroes tomado por la protesta""? Colocar ""Monumento facista"" es en si teñir el post de un color político y darle un valor de juicio, en especial porque no estamos en un subreddit de historia y apreciación arquitectónica, ni en una cátedra de historia artística. Tampoco el post lo colocaste para hablar de los sutiles detalles políticos y artísticos del diseño del monumento. Qué esperabas?"

Teníamos 12 años y nunca se me va olvidar todos los comentarios racistas e ignorantes q ella tuvo q soportar, es increíble cómo en un país mestizo hay gente q se cree superior por el simple hecho de ser pálidos.

Considerando que hay denuncias similares sobre las políticas de ambos Estados antes de que iniciaran las protestas y la respuesta de ambos - criminalización de la protesta, detenciones arbitrarias, muertes a manos de los organismos de seguridad, censura - durante las mismas; y si asumimos como cierto que la protesta es responsable de desabastecimiento, eliminación de puestos de trabajo, quiebra de empresas, contracción del agro y radicalización política necesariamente tenemos que asumir como cierta una de las dos afirmaciones:

1. La consecuencia de las protestas recae sobre los manifestantes y el gobierno está en el deber de emplear los medios a su alcance para restituir el orden público. Ello vindicaría la actuación de Maduro y de Chávez antes de él. 

2. La consecuencia de las protestas recae sobre el gobierno que no quiere ceder a las demandas sociales. Ello condenaría la actuación de Duque durante esta crisis. 

En ninguno de los dos casos sale bien parado el gobierno colombiano, sobre todo por el enorme empeño que ha puesto en rivalizar con el venezolano en cuestión de derechos humanos."

&#x200B;

"""""" Paso 4: busca atraer, no dominar 

Cada movimiento busca corregir alguna injusticia, por lo que es fácil caer en la trampa de demonizar al otro lado. Sin embargo, aquí es donde muchos movimientos se descarrilan. La ira es un movilizador eficaz, pero la ira sin esperanza es una fuerza destructiva. Necesita presentar un caso afirmativo con tácticas afirmativas. Por eso es mejor comenzar con metas pequeñas y alcanzables. Los aliados de Gandhi cuestionaron su idea de hacer del impuesto a la sal un foco principal del movimiento de independencia de la India, porque estaban a favor de un plan para un cambio integral, pero vio que un solo problema, incluso uno pequeño, podría unificar la nación y romper el monopolio del Raj británico. en el poder.  Las tácticas baratas, fáciles de replicar y de bajo riesgo son las que tienen más probabilidades de éxito. Son la forma en que puede movilizar los números que necesita para influir en un pilar de poder, ya sea que esa influencia sea disruptiva, movilizadora o sacando a la gente del medio del espectro de aliados, especialmente si sus tácticas se consideran positivas y de buen humor.  Es muy probable que bloquear calles y tirar piedras a la policía ahuyente a los que están en medio de su espectro de aliados y hará que sea decididamente más difícil obtener el apoyo de las instituciones dentro de los pilares del poder. Durante las elecciones presidenciales estadounidenses de 2016, por ejemplo, los ""Bernie bros"" pueden haber enfurecido a los partidarios más fervientes de Bernie Sanders, pero probablemente desanimaron a muchos de los que necesitaba desesperadamente ganarse.

6008,"Es en Cali, aquí hicieron lo que se les dio la hp gana. Muchos salieron a marchar y protestar pacíficamente pero otros fueron a hacer vandalismo. Así no es la
Cosa. Después se andan quejando
Cuando la policía va y los coge. Aquí incendiaron varios buses del mío, una estación, la oficina de la dian ( había empleados allí) , saquearon almacenes, robaron almacenes de motos, robaron el
Éxito de la Simón Bolívar pero hubo marchantes que alcanzaron a recuperar y regresar cosas. 
Ojalá nos dejen a la PM permanente porque el alcalde soquete que tenemos en Cali de seguridad nada."
6009,Estan dañando un banco. En Colombia los bancos mandan al gobierno. Simple.
6010,"Se quedan sin trabajo por quemar el banco? Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhah
Será que van a soltar ese negocito tan melo"
6011,"Creo que el punto del vídeo y la discusión en general que se trataba de fomentar, era acerca de que, aunque este justificado el descontento de las personas, no hay razones para atemorizar, herir o perjudicar de alguna manera a la gente del común. Usted mismo pudo escuchar el temor de la mujer del video, que gracias a Dios no le pasó a mi madre ni a alguien de mi familia, pero si le pasó a alguien más. Por los miedos que he pasado por el egoísmo, desesperación o simple avaricia de otro, me gustaría no le pasará a nadie más. 

No me mal entienda, considero que la protesta era necesaria, pues las injusticias ya son tan claras y evidentes que pareciera ni siquiera intentarán disimular,  pero bajo ninguna razón otra persona, en sus mismas condiciones, tenga que salir lastimada por otro que quiere expresar su enojo."

Sin embargo, esta no es la manera, ciertamente. Ojalá todos podamos aspirar a una calidad de vida mejor con dirigentes decentes en un futuro cercano."

6021,"Que pesar de el negocio común. Gente que lucha día a día para una comida. Las empresas grandes para eso tienen seguro, en unos días tendrán un cheque en la mano, por las empresas grandes no me siento mal. Lo que si me siento mal es de la gente que trabaja en esos negocios grande/pequeños. Que trabajo tendrán el día de mañana? Que pesar.

Destruyen a donde lo mandan ?"
6026,"Literal usted tiene razón, el guarda es reubicado porque generalmente la seguridad es tercerizada, lo mismo la persona del aseo, y generalmente tanto el inmueble como lo que se almacena esta asegurado, el daño mas bien es para la aseguradora.

Edit: Además esas en posiciones tercerizadas guardas / empleados de aseo generalmente siempre necesitan personal porque alguien se enferma / se accidenta / tiene calamidades domesticas etc...

Elucubrando, a la persona del banco seguramente la pongan a cubrir turnos en otros lugares."
6027,"Creo yo que es una cosa romper vidrios y demas, y otra causar daños fisicos a alguien, en este caso el manager del banco tiene toda la culpa, sabiendo que hay una protesta lo que prima es la seguridad de los individuos, pero que mejor ejemplo del absoluto desinterés y falta de caracter ético y moral de estas instituciones que hacerlos ir a trabajar sin importar las consecuencias. En un pais como Polombia a los bancos no les interesa que les rompan los vidrios, asalten a sus empleados y demas, lo material esta asegurado por aseguradoras (que en su mayoria son de su propiedad) y si no el desgobierno les cubre los daños, respecto a los empleados....cual es el costo de contratar a alguien nuevo?, lamentablemente que alguien sufriera heridas si es el caso, pero es solo una muestra del valor de los individuos en una sociedad tan podrida como la de Polombia, lo mejor es que con todo y paro el desgobierno seguirá con su ""reforma"", solo queda esperar que lo que venga sea peor por que desafortunadamente no se ve otra salida."
6028,Usted es la clase de narcisistas que termina dañado a este país. 60% de la población en pobreza y usted ve una protesta en contra de una reforma que les pasa por encima como un acto de vandalismo. Usted debería retirarse de toda forma de comunicacion y dejar que las personas con un mínimo de empatia de hecho logre opinar.

6034,[deleted]
6035,Pues tenia entendido que una de las principales razones de la marcha de ayer era para que no se le subieran los impuestos a nadie.
6036,Y cuántos dias va a durar el banco dañado?
6037,Y no solo eso. El banco lo arreglan y ya. Durará un dia o dos cerrado y ya todos vuelven a lo suyo. Cuántos bancos en la historia del país han cerrado una sede despues de un tropel?
6038,"De que habla usted?, desde cuando protestar se convirtió en sinónimo de hacer mierda los servicios públicos y destruir locales? Usted seguro es uno de esos vándalos que no tienen empatia por lo que destruyen, le cuento que todos esos buses y locales destruidos no se arreglaran por obra y gracia, usted debería retirarse de toda forma de comunicación y dejar que las personas con un mínimo de empatia y sentido de pertenencia logre opinar"

6040,"Si, bueno... Tampoco soy amiga de una besatón o a convertirme en Gandhi. Pero me gustaría que las cosas fueran más ""civilizadas"". Algo muy utópico dadas las circunstancias."
6041,Si pero esas personas tenían miedo de morir y muchas personas son cajeros y si los roban quien paga? El banco? El dueño de ese banco? No sale de sus pagas y si mueren y tienen familia ?
6042,"Parce los dueños de grandes empresas, bancos, etc tienen la capacidad, medios y dinero para sencillamente cerrar, largarse y abrir en otro lad, lo hemos visto suceder muchas veces, por eso mismo no entiendo por que atacan negocios pequeños y medianos. Son gente que talvez no puedan recuperarse, mucho menos bajo las condiciones actuales, protestar está bien, vandalismo no, mucho menos a pequeños y medianos negocios."
6043,Porqué esta historia suena a historia falsa para dar lástima? 🤔
6044,"A ver le cuento: en Cali el año pasado quemaron dos bancos ; 1 ya lo abrieron después de como dos meses , el otro aún no lo abren porque pues lo destruyeron todo. Los que trabajaban en ese se quedaron sin empleo. Lo sé porque la cuñada de una amiga trabajaba allí y no pudieron ubicarla en otra sucursal. Una familia que quedó sin ingresos ."
6045,"Los pequeños locales están siendo atacados por la pomicia. El transporte público es tan caro que una persona trabajadora no se puede montar. De nuevo, esos daños los hace la policía, y si usted cree que soy un vandalo por decirle a la cara que un gobierno entero lo convence a usted que las protestas están mal usando a agentes de la fuerza pública, pues si soy un vandalo, mientras que usted solo se sienta dejando que que el país se venga abajo por su propia condesencia. Retirese."
6046,"Esos buses, aparte de que son un sistema fallido, son de un operador privado. Eso lo paga una aseguradora privada."
6047,"Bueno y los robaron? Hay denuncias? Les hicieron algo. Cagada el miedo a morir, pero esto es Colombia. Vivir con miedo es lo que nos toca a todos. Da tristeza pero es así."
6048,"Sí, los negocios pequeños y los bienes públicos deben ser protegidos.

pero deje la fantasía. Los bancos jamás se van a ir de Colombia. Tienen uno de los margenes de intermediacion más altos del mundo. Al nivel de Africa. Será que van a soltar esa tetica tan deliciosa que somos los colombianos, que hasta en una pandemia nos arrodillamos para rescatarlos a ellos de primeros.

Me puede decir cuáles son las muchas veces en que se ha visto eso suceder, por favor?"

6050,"Los vándalos siempre han existido, no es como que se generan mágicamente cada protesta y después de la protesta desaparecen, o usted cree que el término ""Vandalismo"" es exclusivo para las protestas?, pueden haber policías vandalizando, como también gente a la  que les gusta destruir cosas, lo llame vándalo por concluir que voy en contra de la protesta porque no apoyo el Vandalismo, además ese argumento de que ""los buses son muy caros y no se pueden montar la gente trabajadora"" entonces por eso esta bien destruirlos?





Nadie cree que las protestas están mal, lo que está mal es el Vandalismo"

6052,"Eso mismo decían los Venezolanos que no se irían, que no sucedería, ya sabemos el resto...y si vamos por lo que dice no se va el banco como tal, pero sus dueños si y los fregados seguimos siendo nosotros, pa lo que les importa, mientras que pequeño negocios son los negocios de la gente que uno conoce, amigos de uno, familiares que se han esforzado para tener lo que tienen, eso que hicieron no fue más que vandalismo y la embarraron, todo comenzó bien hasta que comenzaron con eso."
6053,“Conocido” tiene 170.000 seguidores 😅
6054,"Todos esos SITM son el gran robo del uribismo. El operador se queda con el 95% de las ganancias y la ciudad con 5%, pero la ciudad construye las vias y las estaciones. El robo del siglo. Que ardan. Por algo en todas las ciudades los SITM los entregaron a medias, llenos de elefantes blancos, estan quebrados, dan pesimo servicio etc, son monumentos a la corrupcion."

6057,"Como que no, mire no mas nuestro propio país, no contemos 2020 por la pandemia, pero en el 2019 cuantas multinacionales se fueron? Phillip Morris, Mars, krispy creme, etc, lo mismo los dueños de negocios nacionales, cierra y se van a vivir a Estados Unidos, Canadá, Europa, etc y eso son las grandes empresas, ahora dañar negocios pequeños que talvez no tengan chance de recuperación? De nuevo protestar esta bien, vandalismo no."
6058,"Pues ese hecho en particular no. Pero ese hecho no es un sintoma, es una consecuencia. La gente está harta de andar en esos sistemas BRT caros, contaminantes, corruptos etc. Entonces quemarlos es simbolico. Para eso sirve. Como han servido todas las manifestaciones ciudadanas violentas. O usted cree que en algun país las cosas cambiaron con besatones y chocolatones? Encima en colombia las cosas se arreglan así. Las elites nos arreglan asi, con ejercitos legales, ilegales y burocraticos. Es el momento de hacernos sentir. Me da un poco de cagada con J pantano pero que coman mierda los dueños de esos buses en serio."
6059,Aja. Y cuántos bancos se han ido de Colombia?
6060,"No soy de Colombia pero estoy muy interesado en esto.  ¿Alguien sabe de un sitio donde pueda seguir este tema, la política colombiana y tal?

muy interesado en escuchar el resultado de esta protesta."
6061,"Tienes razon con esto fijo van a ""nesecitar"" mas fondos para reparar todo. Y luego hay que ver como se van a dispara los casos y se llenan las ucis, para luego verlos peleando por lo de la sanidad. Que círculo visioso mas hijueputa."
6062,"Este post es la perfecta muestra de que en Colombia no va a cambiar nada, mucho menos por la que quizá sea la única via posible: las protestas.

Aquí la gente se comió el cuento de que la protesta debe ser súper pacífica, serena, calladita, por el andén, pidan permiso, sólo pueden protestar de X a Y hora y no hagan mucho ruido porque qué molestia. Hasta salen a hacer rídculos como bailecitos, cantar canciones y llenar la protesta de memes porque ""hombre, es que esas no son maneras"".

Es que, en serio, imaginate a Duque y Carrasquilla súper preocupadisimos porque salieron a hacer una marchita por el andén y llegaron a un parque a hacer sancocho. ¡QUE SUSTO TAN TENAZ DE POR DIOS! Yo no sé cómo es que los franceses lograron los [acuerdos de Grenelle en el 68](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp-VXKQuQig) casi que acabando con París, cuando acá tenemos la mejor fórmula: Besatones, chocolatadas y ""no me tumbe el poste hermano, que esas no son formas""

Definitivamente, no hay ser más subdesarrollado, perdidamente cobarde e incorregiblemente sumiso que un Colombiano.  


>Si tanto estudian, actúen con inteligencia, tumbar un poste lo hace cualquier gamín

Ay por dios..."
6063,"Es un mal necesario para llamar la atención del ejecutivo y producir cambios. Una protesta sin tensión social es totalmente ignorada. Cuantas marchas no hemos tenido sin cambios? Cuantas veces no se ha marchado en Colombia y simplemente las cosas no cambian?

Es cierto que destruir bienes públicos es falto de toda logica. Pero recuerde que gran parte de los activos del estado y de los bancos estan asegurados por pólizas que cubren estos riesgos. No digo que por eso sea inteligente destruir todo (las primas de los seguros aumentan a mayor el riesgo) pero no es tampoco cierto que al pobre gobierno le toque quebrarse para pagar eso."
6064,"El país no evolucionará hasta que ""los buenos"" no hagan lo propio. No puede ser que sigan con los mismos métodos violentos de hace 30 años para manifestar desacuerdo con un gobierno tan débil como el de Duque"
6065,"Digale eso a los ñeros y a los locos de la calle,me dejaron con las ventanas rotas y las rejas todas dañadas solo porque la policia llego a un supermercado que estaban saqueando y se empezaron a pedrear, y si asi esta cali no me imagino por otros lados, y casi se me meten a la casa por defenderme y me pedrearon el cuarto de mis hermanas, sinceramente ya no le veo esperanza de mejora a colombia y pienso mudarme de aqui lo mas pronto posible antes de que me pase algo peor."
6066,"Usted de que habla de la plata que nos cuesta la protesta cuando nos van a clavar la tributaria a punta de billones ahi esta lo grave. Hablando de centavos cuando nos sacan millones por atras, prioridades porfavor."
6067,DÍA DE BRUTOS !
6068,"Pues mira, la pandemia ha sido devastadora con los más pobres. En este momento de crisis económica, las fotos multas no han bajado de precio. No hay ayudas del gobiernos. Los pequeños negocios quebrados o apenas sobreviviendo.
La gente aquí está MAMADA de la mala gestión del gobierno, de ver cómo los políticos se roban la ata de frente mientras las personas que viven al día de vender cosas en los semáforos o en las calles aguantan hambre por los toques de queda.
Es natural que la rabia general estalle. Antes de juzgar este tipo de cosas, te invito a ver qué tan privilegiado estás, para juzgar a quienes están sobreviviendo son migajas diarias"

Ellos nos roban, dan la orden que disparen y gaseen... pero esas no son formas.

No hay mayores acomodados que los antiuribistas rolos que creen que con besatones se gana algo mientras en otras partes del país matan a orden de nuestros honorables parlamentarios.

Le tienen mas miedo a ser “gamines” que a ser robados, esclavizados y humillados por toda vida.

Irónicamente tontos. No le echan cinco minutos de cabeza a la vaina."

No lleve billetera, solo vaya con un documento de identidad y solo dinero en efectivo. Tampoco lleve celular de alta gama, las situaciones se salen muy fácil de control y si puede ir acompañado y avisando a algún familiar o amigo en que parte se encuentra y establezca un sitio de recogida en caso que la situación no de más.

Si la situación se sale de control, retírese del lugar, en las manifestaciones violentas los que pagan el ""pato"" son los menos experimentados o los curiosos."

6102,"Edit: Lo siento, creí que buscabas ""tips"" y consejos xd. En cualquier caso dejo el comentario por si a alguien le sirve.

Definitivamente lleva agua con bicarbonato de sodio, es un muy buen neutralizante para el gas lacrimógeno que tiran fuera de las universidades (dentro de estas tiran uno muchísimo más fuerte y el bicarbonato casi no sirve). Comprate uno o dos sobrecitos y revuelvelos en una botella de agua; si te empieza a picar la nariz/ojos, aplica en la cara y eso te va a aliviar bastante. Si ves a alguien que está sufriendo por el gas, ofrecele neutralizante, enserio que andar por ahí con esa mierda es muy fastidioso, y les va a salvar de pasar un rato malo. NO apliques agua potable en la cara, solo empeora la picazón.

Si planeas grabar casos de abuso policial o similares, NO uses desbloqueo biométrico (huella o facial) de celular, sino una contraseña, así no lo van a poder desbloqueae facilmente y eliminar la evidencia. Si quieres grabar capuchos o gente así, evita grabarles la cara, ya que suelen ser algo pesados con eso.

Ten cuidado con el celular, muchos malandros aprovechan la acumulación de personas para ver que se pueden robar de los bolsillos de otros. 

De ser posible, lleva una pila extra, o esas pilas portables, o al menos un cargador; estar incomunicado con tus amigos/conocidos/familiares cuando todo se pone denso es una situación que debes evitar.

Lleva líquido para hidratarte, las caminatas suelen ser largas :'v

Lleva sombrilla. A veces hace muuucho sol o se pone a llover, y esta ayuda bastante. Definitivamenre vale la pena la molestia de tener que cargarla.

Si estás en Bogotá, lleva la tarjeta del SITP, así sin importar a donde termines dando a parar, cuando ya te vayas a retirar y volver a tu casita, vas a poder hacerlo con facilidad (el mapa del celular o preguntarle a personas que atienden negocios también ayuda).

En caso de que la cosa se llegue a poner muy muy turbia y estés muy en medio del caos, no te asustes por las aturdidoras y empieces a correr a lo loco a atropellar a todo el mundo, estas no hacen realmente nada, solo es el ruido. Respecto a los granadas de gas, los del ESMAD inicialmente las tiran como ""rodando"" por el piso, y luego las tiran en forma de tiro parabolico, asi que mira hacia arriba y evita que te golpee una de estas (un casco también puede ayudar). Mucho cuidado con tu cabeza, si una de estas cosas te golpea en la cabeza, va a ocacionar muchisimo daño, llegando a incluso ser letal. NO las patees ni las cogas con la mano, suelen estar *muy* calientes, y patearlas solo es buscar hacerle daño a alguien más que está corriendo por ahí.

Del resto te diría que te calmes un poco, no es tan malo como uno cree o ve por ahí. En realidad el 95% del tiempo es casi como una ""fiesta"" en cierto sentido cultural. Cuando se pone denso, si estás lejos del epicentro (>100m), lo peor que vas a pasar es la molestia del gas, cosa que el agua con bicarbonato quita. En cualquier caso, trata de estar atento de tu alrededor, ya que los policias a veces tratan de acorralar a las personas asi no hagan nada malo.

Por último, enserio lleva agua con bicarbonato.

Cualquier duda me avisas"
6103,"wow tan peligroso es y pa que la gorra suerte que ire con mi papa y una pregunta mas uno no puede irse con botas y pantalon verde es que alguien me dijo que si uste se iba asi lo confundian con un bachiller de la policia a si perdon por ser algo inculto pero que es ""pagar el pato"""

En todo caso, por ese sector ya no habían protestas, incluso presencia de la policía en motos y tanqueta, no hay calles bloqueadas. Este era un grupo de periodistas que están de regreso y desde una calle contraria estaban estos señores disparando en contra de las pocas personas que ya iban de regreso. No es el único caso hoy en Medellín, hace pocos minutos llego una alerta de policías armando civiles en cercanías de el parque de los deseos y denuncias de casos en los que están forzando a las personas detenidas a dar testimonio en su contra, obligándolos a decir que están cometiendo actos vandálicos en la ciudad. En general, hoy a sido el día de mas violencia en el marco del paro nacional, han habido más muertos y heridos que en días anteriores."

>No son comerciantes

Ha habido vandalismo, como el video evidencia. Ese es un banco completamente en llamas al minuto 1:17:51. No me parece descabellado pensar que civiles se pongan agresivos defendiendo sus barrios o negocios."
6110,"Deja de regar desinformación. Esta gente está de noche en un barrio que no es de ellos y se ve que los vándalos ya han quemado bastante propiedad privada. Tiene sentido que la gente no quiera a nadie ahí cerca. Puede que ellos en específico sean inocentes pero por las cagadas de algunas ratas que hacen vandalismo, los propietarios de negocios y la gente que vive  ahí no quiere a nadie en ese barrio. Tiene sentido, ¿Quién quiere que le dañen su fuente de trabajo o de vivienda?

¿Usted quiere que eso cambie? A bueno, entonces también denuncie a las ratas que hacen el vandalismo. Así, van a dejar a la gente que hace protestas pacíficas actuar. 

Pero si seguimos permitiendo a los vándalos actuar, no nos van a dejar protestar pacíficamente por una causa justa."
6111,"Felicitaciones, muy buen análisis del vídeo completo, pero, en el momento y lugar cuando son atacados los periodistas, ve usted disturbios? Ve calles bloqueadas? Ve que los que graban atenten contra alguien, que pueda provocar una reacción así? Justifica usted entonces, que otras personas anden por las calles disparando a lo que se atraviese en su camino? Creo que no dije que durante el día no hayan existido actos vandálicos ni nada parecido, me refiero por tanto, a que unas personas son atacadas en presencia de la policía por parte de civiles armados. Dije algo incorrecto?"
6112,"Deja de criticar sin tener un contexto. Si usted se tomara la molestia de ver el video completo, del cual publique el enlace en un comentario anterior, se daría cuenta que los que están grabando, no son manifestantes, ni atacaron algo o alguien. Están documentando lo que pasa de parte y parte. Pero claro! Es tan fácil lanzar juicios desde la comodidad de una pantalla. Vea el vídeo y desmienta lo que digo. LOS QUE GRABAN EL VIDEO, SON PERIODISTAS, creo que en ningún momento dije algo diferente a eso, o si?"
6113,"Ahh otra pregunta, es que acaso hay horarios establecidos para estar en determinados lugares? Es decir, yo no puedo ir a otro barrio en la noche, porque eso justifica que otra persona me ataque, solo por sospecha?"
6114,"Jamás dije que los que filmaban eran manifestantes. ¿Tal vez no sabes leer bien?

Si dije que es de sentido común que si han habido vándalos (cosas muy distintas) ahí en esa área haciendo daños (vi secciones del vídeo y hay lugares prendidos en fuego), la gente que vive o trabaja ahí no quiere que nadie se acerque a esa área.

Ellos no saben quién es quién en estos momentos y si hay alguien que no te quiere cerca a sus negocios debes respetar eso, ya hay mucha gente disfrazada de manifestante o periodista que ha resultado ser un criminal."
6115,"Usted no sabe con qué tipo de gente esos propietarios tuvieron que lidiar anteriormente. Usted y yo no tenemos contexto suficiente de esto. La gente tiene que aprender a respetar los espacios. 

En la noche obviamente que la gente tiene la guardia más alta puesto que ahí es cuando los malandros aprovechan para robar y vandalizar. Si estás en un barrio ajeno de noche te expones a esto."

6140,Para que duque deje de robar de la clase media
6141,"No soy experta en el tema, pero básicamente la implementación del iva (impuestos del 19%) en servicios básicos, gasolina, canasta familiar, y producción de alimentos es como terminar de clavarle el puñal a la clase baja, media y trabajadora que ya está sufriendo intentando sobrevivir durante la crisis económica de la pandemia. 

Si ya mucha gente está bajo la línea de pobreza, camellando, y viviendo del trabajo informal del día a día, ¿como pretende el gobierno que el pueblo pueda sobrevivir si todo sube de precio?

6147,covid
6148,"Ese IVA es irrelevante pues se les hace retorno, y en la reforma viene también una renta mínima vitalicia para compensar a cualquier persona bajo la linea de pobreza. La reforma afecta más a la clase media, y aún así la expansión de la base tributaria solo afecta al 10% con mayores ingresos en el país, si algo solo opino que debería ser todavía mayor el incremento a los impuestos al 1%, que aunque hubo incremento no me pareció suficiente."
6149,"Por eso y más; quieren meternos impuesto por servicios públicos, por tener carro, por movilizarse en la ciudad, por pensión, por ganar más de 2,5 millones de pesos al mes para luego en el 2023 ponerles impuesto a quienes ganen más de 1.2 millones al mes (Casi que el salario mínimo para ese año, si es que siquiera lo suben a ese monto, claro). Básicamente, un impuesto por trabajar, impuesto hasta por morirse (y no estoy exagerando, realmente quieren ponernos impuesto por servicios funerarios).  
Y sé que me faltó más por decir, y si quieren [“Aquí un breve resumen en video""](https://www.instagram.com/p/COO4YSFjSQN/)"
6150,"En realidad no todos usan la Whipala como bandera para identificar a los pueblos indígenas en su totalidad. Por decir un ejemplo en Argentina y Chile el pueblo mapuche (que actualmente están en un conflicto con los gobiernos de ambos países por el tema de las tierras) usa [esta bandera](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/Causa_mapuche.jpg) (entre otras) para representarse. La Whipala (al menos en Argentina, Bolivia, Chile y Perú) es usada para representar a los pueblos andinos (principalmente a los aymaras y quechuas), por lo que el resto de pueblos indígenas no se identifica con esa bandera."
6151,Let me guess: you would prefer if everyone stayed locked indoors indefinitely.
6152,"También tenia entendido eso, y es justamente esa la razón por la que me hace tanto ruido que la usen porque los pueblos andinos del tawantinsuyo como los que mencionas son  ultraminoritarios en nuestro pais y no tiene mucho sentido usar sus simbolos (tengo entendido que apenas tienen población en nariño y poco mas), además de que otros pueblos como los wayuu y los misak que están mas presentes también tienen sus banderas pero hasta ahora no he visto que las usen en protestas."
6153,"Yo hablaba más a nivel continental que su uso no está extendido, sino a nivel regional.

Yo creo que la razón por la que se ve a gente usando esa bandera es más que nada por ser la más popular. Al menos yo como extranjero no conozco nada de los pueblos indígenas de Colombia, y dado las imágenes que he visto en varios portales sobre el ambiente político del país me da la impresión de que su peso no es el mismo que en los otros países que mencioné."

6158,"Un artículo sobre la reforma propuesta para la policía a partir de los problemas de abuso de autoridad y falta de transparencia durante las protestas, es un problema que claramente existía desde antes, lo vimos durante 2020 y 2019, y verdaderamente me alegra que estemos alejándonos más de la policía corrupta y criminal que heredamos del conflicto interno Colombiano.

Me cuentan que piensan de la reforma."
6159,"uniformes azules?, se aburrieron de que les dijeran aguacates?"
6160,"Si tapan los números de identificación como no van a ser capaces de tapar las bodycams. La reforma no está en los elementos tangenciales de la institución. Está en el tipo de educación y capacitación que les dan a los reclutas. Como cuando vino el neonazi Alexis López, a dar charlas en la Universidad Militar Nueva Granada. Hay que enseñarles a la policía que TODOS somos colombianos, no solo los que se ponen camisetas blancas."
6161,La principal arma que debería utilizar la policía es la educación. Aprender a manejar situación educarse para tratar personas y no amedrentar como en general lo hacen. Aunque hay que ser claro no son todos.
6162,"Sin leer el artículo porque no quiero generarles tráfico a los de Semana...creo que es algo que se viene pidiendo a gritos desde hace rato, ya no solo por lo brutos que son para reprimir a los ciudadanos sino por la corrupción y toda la oscuridad que hay por dentro. Lo que no entiendo es cómo van a hacer para volver a lavarle el cerebro a los policías, eso va a tardar años pero ojalá salga bien. Todos los policías de todo el mundo son un asco, por cierto."

6164,¿Que uniforme es mejor el nuevo o el anterior? Abro debate

Hoy fue hundida una reforma contra el abuso policial presentada por el representante Inti Asprilla que su lucha contra esta problemática se destaca mucho, pero el gobierno no le quiere dar el lujo de que se apruebe algo tan importante por parte de la oposición."
6170,"El ejército viste de verde prácticamente en todo el mundo y de azul policía.  La policía de Colombia usa el mismo color que los militares.

6185,"Al igual que a todo trabajador a los policías se les entrega dotación cada determinado tiempo, desconozco el tiempo exacto pero trabaje en una empresa en la que tuve 4 cambios de imagen durante mi tiempo de labor Y simplemente esperaban las fechas de las dotaciones para esto.
No me parece tan descabellada la idea y espero que sirva para que la fuerza policial tome conciencia de que también son parte del mismo pueblo al qué sin ánimo de generalizar atacan sin clemencia.
Y digo sin el ánimo de generalizar por qué la realidad es que también hay policías que realizan bien su trabajo y salen todos los días con el ánimo de ayudar."

Pensamiento crítico es *poner en duda* un concepto aceptado por otros como verdad.

6193,"Ah si. Tienes toda la razón. Olvidaba que el financiador de grupos terroristas (?) Gustavo Bolívar también creó el grupo ""Madres Primera Línea"" y ""Niños de la primera línea"", que funcionan como escudos humanos mientras los vándalos saquean locales comerciales."

Nunca se les ve defendiendo a una persona del común, siempre salen es a defender a un ladrón que fue herido por un policía o por alguien que se defendió de el, o en general un bandalista que agredió y lo agreden de vuelta y salen a defenderlo 

Porque solo defienden bandidos es la pregunta..."

6197,"Otro dato clave que perturba a la Corte Interamericana: algunas de las 276 personas que a día de hoy siguen reportadas como desaparecidas en el marco del Paro Nacional **aparecieron** **muertas**.

Traducción (a ver si queda más claro): efectivamente el Estado está capturando, torturando y matando y despareciendo forzosamente.

La ONG Temblores dice que estas desapariciones se adjudican al Estado porque las personas reportan a sus familiares que la policía se los están llevando a un sitio X y cuando los familiares van a preguntar al sitio X no les dan razón de dónde están sus desaparecidos, de manera que así se determina (se filtra por así decirlo) que no son desapariciones independientes del Paro. No hay que esperar ningún tiempo para reportar desaparecidos (a veces dicen que toca esperar 72 horas pero eso es falso), se reporta a alguien como desaparecido en el momento que no se tiene conocimiento de su paradero a pesar de que la policía les dice que están en un lugar en el que realmente no están."

Algunos ineptos se comparan con la revolución francesa, bien, siguen en el siglo 18  mal por ellos, no han aprendido nada de la historia. La violencia solo genera más violencia, no importa tu color o tus convicciones, si sales a dar piedra te dan bala y viceversa.

No hay políticos buenos, no hay redentores, en este país solo se conoce el idioma de la sangre, así que si se matan entre todos la verdad me es indiferente, crecí en Arauca, se lo que es dormir debajo de tu cama escuchando los disparos y las explosiones, se lo que perder familia por los actores violentos,  se que la sangre solo llama más sangre.

Tal vez si los violentos se matan entre ellos y algún dia tendremos paz, pero la guerra es un negocio muy lucrativo así que siempre surgirán más violentos. Como es un ciclo sin fin  prefiero hacerme a un lado y vivir."

Algo que ningun gobernante en la historia del pais ha sido capaz de lograr, todos con el cuentico de que mientras la deuda sea
Sostenible, pueden seguir endeudandose como si no hubiese mañana. Además que Rodolfo es un gran capitalista, nada de maricaditas de socialismo."

Que cuando gobernó como alcalde fue un mierdero con Miles de contratos corruptos. Que dijo públicamente que era el asesor económico de Chávez.

6231,Jaja porque siempre asumen que yo solo me quejo ? Quien dijo que yo no educo o comparto cosas con mi familia o amigos ? Vico en una región donde es uribista por naturaleza y he logrado cambiar esa mentalidad al menos en mi familia 🤷🏻‍♂️
6232,"Disculpa si te ofendí, solo conozco de ti los comentarios que has hecho por acá, me parece excelente que valore la educación en la casa y en sus círculos sociales sobre la mentalidad de calle o corriente común de donde viva, éxito seamos parte de la solución que Latinoamérica la tiene jodida pero tiene con que salir adelante"
6233,"Acá no podemos hacer mucho y que cada uno intérprete para lo que de desde sus sesgos políticas sociales y económicos, acá no se va a cambiar nada, no se conoce a nadie, y pues cada vez que uno dice algo medio coherente, meten a petro o me llaman comunista, guerrillero izquierdozo xD , así que en algún punto solo lo hago por diversión acá"
6234,𝐃𝐞 𝐚𝐜𝐮𝐞𝐫𝐝𝐨!
6235,Estoy de acuerdo. Ya mandé este mensaje por Twitter.
6236,"Los del DDHH son también unos terroristas comprados por la mafia Castro-chavista de petro y patrocinan esas marchas vandálicas.

- un uribista cualquiera"
6237,"Plomo a todos aquéllos que vandalicen. 
Apoyo a los que protestan pacíficamente."
6238,"Sii
#ColombianLivesMatter"
6239,Hay programadas para hoy reuniones con la Corte Interamericana de Derechos Humanos para estudiar la situación
6240,"Apoyo las protestas, **PERO**, no el vandalismo, ni los saqueos ni la violencia. A los que protestan se les olvida mencionar que también hay policías heridos, de hecho, mas de 500.

Ahora, si, han habido violaciones, asesinatos, crímenes, abusos de autoridad, agresiones.

Pero perros, si la misma gente introduce el caos, deben entender que esa es una de las consecuencias. Aparte, los policías actúan así porque el pueblo les enseño que podían actuar así. porque siempre que protestaban en la UNAL o la UPN tiran piedras y papas bomba.

&#x200B;

El problema superficial es el gobierno, pero el de raíz es la cultura de este país, pues la misma gente puso el gobierno, pocos salen en contra del mismo, pero nunca llega a nada, por la misma gente.

&#x200B;

No entiendo cual es la quejadera de la gente al porque no los dejan destruir ciudades, negocios, etc."
6241,"¿Cómo fue o qué? 

Y para los que dicen que sin vandalismo o solo protesta pacifica lo que realmente están diciendo es que apoyan las protestas en las que las personas deben permitir ser constantemente brutalizadas por un estado con la maquinaria para infligir más daño,  o sea  manifestarse, pero que la protesta se mantenga ineficaz, mientras se aboga para que la gente al ver esta brutalidad policial sea movida por la lástima, o sea la violencia si es aceptable, pero cuando la inflige bajo la primicia mentirosa de mantener el orden. La violencia sistemática y estructural está dentro de este país a la hora del acceso a la salud,  la educación, el trabajo o el mínimo derecho a una vida digna, la violencia ya está en nuestro día a día y esa causa más daño que sus vidrios rotos."
6242,Seria una muy buena idea. LO APOYO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
6243,">ColombianLivesMatter

No, porfavor..."
6244, Totalmente de acuerdo con usted. De alguna manera la gente cree que rompiendo vidrios y robando tiendas el país va a progresar. Me encantaría saber cuál es la lógica detrás de eso.
6245,"Dicen que es necesario porque no los han escuchado antes, porque llevan años protestando y nada, pero en realidad es la primera vez que protestan por esto."
6246,"¿Cómo van a decir que llevan años protesta do por una reforma que se sacó hace unas semanas? Además, los actos vandálicos lo único que logran es desprestigiar la protesta, la gente en vez de apoyar le da la espalda a este tipo de movilizaciones precisamente cuando hay violencias."
6247,"No me pregunte eso, yo no se. Pero la lógica de ellos es que llevan protestando toda la vida (así la mayoría no tenga ni 25 años) y nunca los escuchan. 

En vez de ir al congreso a dar ponencias y así.

Yo siempre pongo el ejemplo de que los residentes médicos lograron ganarse un salario y los pilotos hace 3 años bloquearon el país en busca de mejores condiciones laborales (aunque los culearon diciendo que es un servicio vital básico cuando no lo es) sin romper un solo vidrio.
La gente que va por la violencia se va es por el camino fácil y no por las vías que tienen para ser escuchados, esa es básicamente la historia de nuestro país desde la creación de las farc, pero ahora alimentado es por las redes sociales. Reddit también siempre está en el limbo entre progresismo y a veces pensamiento lógico. 

Uno pensaría que porque se empapan más de conocimiento aquí pensarían pero no, aquí son a veces igual de basura que en Facebook."
