Who you gonna call?
Does anyone know of how I can support protesters hurt or families affected? I can’t find any of these resources
"“Far-right regime” is a bit of an over exaggeration , don’t you think ?"
"I'm against the government and the reform they are trying to implement, but stop spreading misinformation. The government in Colombia is not far right and nobody is ""massacring"" protestors. The fact that people are marching in protest means that there is opposition."
Where the Venezuelans in all this?
Ghostbusters! Tuturu tutu
Charity funds.
"Exaggeration?
Lmao."
There videos on here of police shooting protestors
Dude. The human rights international twitter acc has declared this a humanitarian crisis. Over 37 people have died already.
"Yes, exaggeration. Care to explain what is ""far right"" of this whole situation?"
"It's far right when you have fascist and ultra conservative people, telling others to behave in determined way, plus usually far-right movements use the excuse that the left is going to ruin everything when they are the ones pursuing everything that wants equality for everyone.
Colombia has a huge rate of inequality due to this far-right government, hope this explain the situation, feel free to ask anything"
"1. How is ultra conservatism relevant exactly?  Sure, The government is in the control of the conservatives, but there is nothing remotely close to what can be called fascist.  The rights of the sexual, racial and religious minorities are guaranteed by the constitution and there hasn't been any attempt to take that back. The comparison on this aspect is horrific and cruel if I'm being completely honest.
2. Fascism isn't when conservative people tell people to behave a certain way. Fascism comes from the book ""The doctrine of fascism"" which concludes that human life has no value other than to serve the state, which ends in totalitarism. Colombia isn't a totalitarian country. There are several political parties, a congress, freedom of press and rights. The violation of human rights although very frequent in fascist countries does not mean that everytime an agent of the state commits a human rights violation the country is fascist itself. Policies need to be looked at in order to determine this.
3. Why is inequality even relevant? It has nothing to due with whether or not the government is far right. Despite your attempt to present your situation as ""left wing is when equality and right wing is inequality and when you have got a shit ton of inequality it is far right"" it doesn't work that way. The left and the right, both in an economic and cultural sense,  and have fixed perspectives. Sure, you may argue that the effect of said perspective in the world causes inequality but it isn't the defining trait. I would argue that in the economic aspect the so called ""right wing"" parties are far from the perspective of the economic right wing. That's also why I asked what was so far right of the government, as colombia's internal market is highly regulated, lots of subsidies for companies and there are high taxes both for companies and people.
4. The idea that this is neoliberalism or austerity measures are to blame for this mentioned by  OP demonstrates little understanding of the situation. The reform seeks to collect money to cover its previous expenses, which wouldn't have happened if it had controlled its expenses in the first place. High government spending is generally against the free market because it requires heavy taxation. That's why classical liberals are opposed to it. 

This makes me conclude OP is wrong about how he paints the situation. One can criticize the crimes of the police without being so misleading."
"The ultra conservatism is relevant when it goes against progress in a country that has no opportunities, when you see the situation from
Outside and manipulated news you can’t understand the true here, minorities have issues specially Afro, indigenous and LGBT, constitutional rights are for few not for all.
Colombia is actually under totalitarian regime even if it is shown as something different, human life has no value if not, maybe we had a better management of the pandemics, not being the slowest vaccination rate in the region, at this moment we have no real right of speech and media in being controlled, again what you see is different to what is truly happening here.
Inequality comes when the same rich families keep doing whatever they want with the government making rich people richer and medium class and poor ones poorer, most of taxes are being paid by medium class (same problem Venezuela has few years ago) I’m not having fixed views, just analyzing that here corruption is what leads all politics.
The true behind the reform is to solvent all the money that has been taken by the corrupts, there are better ways to get money that has been recklessly expend by those politicians in things that are not being in favor of the Country but instead of their own benefits again, you need to be here and live it to understand that people is getting poorer and the government is seeking to bleed it way more.

Let’s explain something Colombia’s legal monthly minimum wage is U$250 if you earn more than U$400 according to this government you are rich, most of the people earn less than that like U$100 a month to live, eat, study, transport ETC, Colombian peso is highly devaluated and unemployment is at its highest point ever. 

Now tell me again that colombia is not ruled by a totalitarian government and that nefast reform is needed, ah plus we have 32 states (regiones) and we have around +500 representatives and senators, that’s one of the main problems taking into account that every one of those so called public servants earn U$10,000 just as their salaries and they get contracts for U$10M or more bleeding the state, again do you need a better insight of a totalitarian regime hidden in a democratic facade?"
"First of all I'd like to know what rights are being stripped away from indigenous, afros and people from the LGBT community, as they are indeed guaranteed by the constitution (Art 11, Art 12, Art 13, Art 14,Art,15, Art 16, Article 17, Art 18, Art 19 being the main ones). As a member of the LGBT I really would like to know what right I don't have to impose the ""tutelas"" I have to.

Second, there seems to be over here in social media de idea that opposing change of any kind is of pure hate towards the country. I find it really harmful people can't comprehend a disagreement, even if it is good faith on the future of the country.   I disagree with them and that doesn't make them fascists. As I already explained fascism is very different.

What does ""better management of the pandemics"" even mean at this point?  Politicians had to play balancing the economy with people's health and closed as much as a third world country could afford: What else you would have done at this?. About 4% of the GDP went in financial help. Sure, there has been corruption and inefficiency in vaccionation, but that has nothing to do with your case to present the government either as far right or totalitarian or even in favor of another political party.

We still have the right of free speech and social media to counter the ""mainstream media"" when they are being disingenous. The right to protest on the other hands gets violated in some cases but given it is not actual policy it is not totalitarism or fascism.

I am aware of the disastrous circumstances of the country at the moment and disagree with the reform proposed. The government already has enough money and should have engaged in measures to ensure this didn't happen. But quoting how rich they are and how poor the normal person is, despite being right, isn't an argument for totalitarism. You should seriously look it up in a dictionary, because right now you are defining everything bad in the country as fascism, totalitarism or far right."
