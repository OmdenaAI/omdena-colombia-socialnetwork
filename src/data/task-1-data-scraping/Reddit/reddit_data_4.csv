How much the police brutality helped to the grow of the protest? People in favor of the government justified everything the police do?
Can someone explain the tax reform and what the governamment were proposing?
"Argentinians in this thread rn are like that ""you guys are getting paid?!"" guy from the meme"
"It's interesting to see that the proposed tax reform for Colombia is very similar to the one the Costa Rican government is trying to pass as part of its commitments to the IMF for a relief plan.

CR is in a similar deficit situation and, thanks to the pandemic, the previous fiscal reform (from 2018 which saw VAT added to services and income tax hikes) showed how short sighted it was in not doing anything to curb spending. So they proposed several taxes last year including more income tax hikes and tripling property taxes. This resulted in a series of protests which made the government backpedal.

They learned from the experience and now introduced the new reform as part of the IMF commitments, with the most vague and surreptitious wording, trying to confuse people and avoid more protests. Things are astonishingly similar to Colombia: lowering the exempt ceiling and changing income thresholds that at least for me will result in a very hefty tax burden increase. It will be interesting to see what happens here when it enters  actual discussion (the government does not have a majority and there are elections next year), so this unfortunate Colombia case can point a bit to what can happen here."
Can someone ELI5?
Colombians: how are you and your families doing during this time? Do you have a sense that the violence will persist or even escalate from here?
It's so weird that Colombia's tax hike would be a tax cut here
"Someone knows what is a ""Revolución molecular disipada""? Uribe tweeted about how the State had to resist to this supposed revolution. But I've never heard about that term before."
"I feel like the comments here have the same issue the current president (Duque) of Colombia has. They're written by people out of touch with the country who have no clue how most people live or how it functions. They think it's the United States or some other place, or they've only been around and lived in the high income areas of Bogota. Even the tax reform changes they've listed are completely wrong. But this is easy to understand. The actual tax reform bill is not the full story. There were many different prepositions that were introduced in the media that did not make it into the tax bill, and overall the entire process made people extremely angry.

It probably has to do with the fact that millions of people don't have jobs having lost them during the pandemic and the country is in the midst of another massive wave of infections.

&#x200B;

There's also the big unspoken fact that more than half of the national budget is stolen through contracts and in Political Salaries which are extremely high. In fact one of the only decent job you can have in Colombia is in fact, being a Politician.

Colombia is a country where the entire political system is designed to ensure control of all wealth production remains in the hands of few who also happen to be the people who control the drug trade, it's economic system doesn't even qualify as capitalism. It is a Narcostate. [To understand modern Colombia you need to watch Gilberto Tobon's video's,  the preeminent authoritative figure on Colombian politics.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTfryt5LnY0)  Any forms of business that threaten the rich ogliarchs ends up being regulated or destroyed by corrupt police, drug linked assasins, or paramilitaries. It's the opposite of a free society. There is frankly little to no social mobility.

Even all this lovely infrastructure that you could say that taxes are used to pay for is used to further control and limit people. There are crazy high road tolls throughout the country (Average fee being around 20,000 pesos for one car, which is the equivalent of $5 and more than half a day's minimum wage, that would be like a toll in the US being $30), hell one of the new propositions of the law was to allow placement of tolls inside cities themselves.

&#x200B;

The Colombian people are angry naturally, because of all these tax dollars that are taxed, little of it is spent on anything they see that actually benefits them.

**And herein lies the great myth of Colombian taxation and wealth. Colombia's government and economy is not poor, there is not a lack of tax funds or money movement. In fact Colombia's Government and economy has massive amounts of money it can spend. The majority of those funds are wasted and go towards the pockets of rich people and politicians instead anything that helps the common man. So why the hell would common people want to continue to raise taxes when they know that most of it is going to go to pay off corrupt politicians and businesmen?**"
What's the capital gains tax in Colombia? Has there been any proposals to increase it over there?
I have a dumb question. Most of what I am seeing is from Cali. So I am wondering if there are also a lot of protests etc happening in Bogota and medellin and other cities? I know that there was when it first started but wondering if those cities are as bad as cali
"As a Colombian living abroad I feel very sad. We could’ve changed things. This presidential term was of utmost importance: it was the first after the peace treaty with FARC. It wasn’t perfect by any means but it meant hope for a lot of people! But no, Duque (representing everything wrong with Colombian politics) won and I knew we fucked up. However I never thought that we had fucked up this bad. Duque singlehandedly destroyed what could’ve been a very promising future for all Colombians.
Sorry for the long post. I’m very disappointed but mostly just sad."
"27 murdered in less than a week, WTF. I guess Duque can do anything as long as he isn't Maduro."
"I agree that the tex reform is needed, BUT they want to tax very basic products like coffee, eggs, milk, etc. they also want to tax the internet and install urban tolls, i.e. within a city, you would have to pay fees in order to circulate. Everything will become more and more expensive. The government claims they will refund the lowerst class, but we know that most of that money will get lost like it usually happens in this country.   


At the same time, people like me, who earn more o less two minimum wages per month (on average) are not elligible for that refund, because statistically speaking we are ""wealthy"". This affects the middle-class more than anything and super rich ones don't get taxed accordingly. This is so unfair for young people like me who are trying go ahead.   


All services will become more expensive for me and no one will help me. But you know what makes me angrier? That the police acts like a bunch of maffiosi. They are dangerous and if I go to protest today, it's because I am appalled by the situation yesterday. .I won't vote for Petro or any uribista, I am sick of this s."
Very sad and awful situtation. I dont know much about Colombian politics but watching some of these videos of protesters being shot and killed is just horrible. I am praying for you Colombia!!
Anyone have news from Cali?
"What the hell is going on in Colombia? I'm from Romania and I've just seen some posts on twitter with the Colombian special forces brutally attacking civilians who were protesting. This hasn't been on any major news channel over here in Europe. 

Can someone give me TLDR?"
"Can anyone explain the scale of these protests/uproar?

I keep trying to find out how bad it's getting but news articles are very vague. Is this like an Arab Spring revolution or is it like Portland Oregon where the protests are only 1-2 city blocks?"
Do you think president duque will be forced to resign?
"There's no chicken, no eggs, no milk, the potatoes' price is now 4 times higher, no gas. The rioters are blocking even the ambulances that don't carry critical patients.

I understand the riots, the reform was really bad planned and they should honestly reduce public worker numbers and their salaries instead of fucking us with more taxes.

The only thing I fear is the rise of Petro to power as he's using this crisis to gain popularity."
Is some type of tax reform necessary for the stability of the government? What is likely to happen if there are no tax increases at all (even a different version that avoids affecting low-income people)?

"I've got a weird question, don't misinterpret it, but *who* are taking part in the protests, apart from the common people? Because I've heard that there are guerrillas and criminal groups who are taking part. And also, do the protests have any sort of political bias? Like, would you say there is any sort of political propaganda or goal to benefit another party/candidate? Because that's really commonplace in our protests here."
I thought the protests were mostly over already since Duque is withdrawing the tax reforms?
Is this going to be a Arab Spring but for Latinamerica
Silver spoon fed posh Colombian children rooting for socialism but against social spending? Is this Opposite Day?
"The protests went down because of sheer misinformation. Taxes will cover the income from the pandemic (yes there is a loan designed for income) and corporations would take the bullet in any case. People are used to punch each others balls, when in fact security and income are doing great."
"Iván Duque’s tax reform was sorely needed. His government needs more revenue. 

But that’s a language that Petro supporters do not speak, and that the people whom like to protest Uribe’s successor do not speak either.

Edit: bunch of petristas below"
[I've found this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOezl-mZJS0) that explains most stuff. Thought?
You are no longer vacationing in iqaqaland anymore??? What happened???
"Colombia is a NARCO-STATE, since 2001 the government sells CoCaine to the Sinaloa's cartel, which are move by daily flights from ""El Dorado"" Airport, the armed forces cover it and that is why they attack the population who already realized it!

Do not trust the lies Colombian government tells, the heads of the armed forces receive annual bonuses of many millions of Colombian money, for their loyalty. Ask for the payrolls of these generals!!

The prosecution, the CTI and the military criminal justice are infiltrated by paramilitary groups and therefore it DOES NOT work and nothing will be clarified !!"

"Hey this is part of the PLANDEMIA to submit the world into slavery. Rise up, its now or never."
Nothings the same without Pablo
Hey colombians why don't you call the muricans?. The love fighting for human rights and all that shit lol.
"Yep, the more violence the more people go out, the more clashes, the more violence, hasta que venga el ejercito y empiece a dispararle a la gente tipo tianamen sq. :/"
[removed]
"The police have been awful in many cases but the protesters are by no means ideal. They've created shortages, stopped all sort of transport, stopped work, stopped everything that the country needs to hold on during the economic crisis brought on by the pandemic. They're also extremely violent in many cases, just like the police."
"* Previously, people earning around 5 minimum wages a month would pay an earning tax (progressive, not flat) the reform proposed to extend the taxing into people earning around 2.7 minimum wages a month.
* The current VAT is of 16%, the reform proposed to hike it to 19% and also proposed to tax more consumption goods and services. Some low earning people would be eligible to VAT refunding.
* The reform proposed taxing pensions amounting to 4.9 monthly minimum wages.
* People earning from 11 minimum wages a month would also pay a ""solidarity tax""

Also there were some reforms and hikes to earnings from stock trading among others."
"Te problem is that there are also a health reform, a labour reform, a pension reform .

They are all terrible, making people subject to exploitation and taking health rights from them.

In summary these all make people much more poor while still taking more money from them.

In contrast all of this could be avoided if these bastards did their job and went after the corrupt politicians that have been pillaging our country since our independence."
"Mr Duque’s reform was sorely needed. His government needs more revenue. Because of the pandemic, Colombia’s deficit has tripled to nearly 8% of GDP. Public debt could reach 108% of GDP in ten years. The reform would have removed many VAT exemptions and reduced the threshold for starting to pay income tax, from which revenues are among the lowest, as a share of GDP, in the OECD, a club of mostly rich countries. Pensions would have been taxed, too. Spending on social programmes would have increased, potentially benefiting 19m people. Mr Carrasquilla claimed the bill could have reduced the share of Colombians who are extremely poor (anyone who earns less than 145,004 pesos a month, or $38) by six percentage points.

Most Colombians, however, saw it as unfair. One of the longest lockdowns in the world has emptied wallets and sapped morale. Since last year 2.8m people have fallen into extreme poverty. More than 500,000 businesses have closed. Even though the tax increases would have hit the wealthiest hardest, many feel that it is not the right time to raise taxes. Fully 80% opposed the bill.

The repression of protests, however violent said protestors could be (these are several tens of thousands of protesters), has the opposite of the wanted reaction.

The bill was not the protesters’ only grievance. Colombians are frustrated, particularly with Mr Duque. The president promised to make the country safer. But violence is getting worse. Colombia is exporting record amounts of cocaine—it still provides around 70% of the world’s supply. Meanwhile illegal armed groups are growing stronger. Since 2016, the year a peace deal was signed with the FARC guerrillas, the remaining groups have driven a growing number of rural Colombians out of their homes and murdered hundreds of social leaders. Colombians, like many people elsewhere, also blame their government for mishandling the pandemic, which is rampaging through the country. Just 7% of the population have had a first jab of the vaccine."
"Hopefully there won't be the violence at least, we're closing in on 40 deaths, over 1000 injured, around 600 of them police officers, and worst of all around 90 missing persons.

We also have elections next year, it going to be such a mess 🙃"
"The deficit situation in El Salvador is becoming critical too, I fear our country might collapse in the next 10 years."
People were protesting against an incoming tax reform and it has devolved into a protest (and riots) against the current government as police and military repression keeps escalating.
"At this point who knows how everything will turn out. It feels bleak, but I guess you could say there's a little glimmer of hope in the fact that people are finally standing up to the government.

There's probably a lot of tension in most families right now. It's not uncommon for older people to say shit in favor of the government or the police and ESMAD (anti riot assholes), so naturally, people are mad at that kind of stuff. In my case, I don't really talk about these topics with my parents, because I know how they think."
"definitely will not escalate much, on social networks the whole thing appears much bigger than what it is (because of the very nature of social networks),  but in reality there isn't that many people in the streets, even, and a good part of the people in the street in the past three days or so belong to some kind of union or collective, who seek an opportunity to demand very concrete things (cab drivers protesting against Uber-like platforms; truck drivers protesting against paytolls, etc)."
"The overwhelming majority of demonstrators profess sympathies for left wing policies, most of them are soc-dems but there are also socialists and even marxists. They've being demonstrating almost continuously since 2018.

Next year Colombia will have presidential elections so I think they won't stop the ""trend"" they started in 2018 in order to prop up at least one of the many presidential candidates they will have."
Honestly I haven’t seen to many protests and stuff though I’m seeing it on the news and it’s kinda bleak
It would be the second tax hike in 4-5 years
Brazilians are probably feeling the same (even if the math doesn't work out)
"It's a term that implies that all of this social movements in Latin America have the objective to destroy the region and goverments to "" spread comunism"" that are without clearly leaders.

Basically it's a conspiracy theory that was created by a Chilean Neo Nazi and supported by far-right politicians all over the region.

[This article](https://m.lasillavacia.com/revolucion-molecular-disipada-invento-neonazi-estudiada-fuerza-publica-81359) from La Silla Vacía is really helpful."
I just saw a comment in world news about this and it is a chilean guy spewing crypto-fascist propaganda
"Yeah, basically this. The protests stopped being about only the reform a long time ago."
"agreed with some things, disagree with others.

we are not from rich families, at least I am from a lower middle class family in a small city.

corruption is not just some rich people and high profile politicians stealing money, it has much, much deeper roots. And it's much more complex than just people taking off money from your pocket.

Colombians are not taxed, very few people pays taxes. This is a fact, scholars and economists would say you so. To use road tolls as an example of people paying taxes is silly, most Colombians don't own a car, even middle class Colombians. Most Colombians don't even have formal jobs, and informal economy doesn't pay taxes.

Gilberto Tobón is a pretty bad analyst, he's just a youtube influencer, with political interests and his speech is extremely simplistic. He's not an expert on these subjects."
This needs more upvotes.
"I checked and the source tells that it's around 10%

The tax reform proposed a hike of it to 17%"
"Yeah it was part of the proposal and people still went against it. The people who say this reform was in favor of the rich somehow overlooked the massive spikes in Capital gains tax, progressive income tax reform, social income for poor, And taxes on high pensions, also at progressive rates.

The reform was a brilliant step to reduce inequality and deficits in one of the most unequal countries in the region, and just because an unpopular president tried it we have this backlash."
I think they tossed in a wealth tax. Will be honest I love Colombia (and still want to visit) but in terms of having it as a future home base kind of faded out of my mind. Still might get a vacation place there as it is pretty nice.
Protests are happening in different cities. The situation in Cali has been the most complicated one.
"Cali is one of the most dangerous cities in the World. Sadly, violence it's pretty common there..."
"Didn't most people disagree with a peace treaty with FARC and the government just went ahead and did it anyway and like, gave them seats in the senate, land and other benefits? AFAIK we're talking about a guerrilla that's responsible for hundreds of terrorist attacks who are now recognized as a political party."
"Yeah, people act like police brutality is fine as long as it isn't being ordered from a socialist or whatever."
"do you know under which circumstances these people got killed, and by whom?"
wait those things are NOT taxed in your country?
But that tax on basic groceries are on the existing one or is a brand new over nothing? Because for example here in Chile we pay 19% on everything we pay to collect taxes
">and install urban tolls, i.e. within a city, you would have to pay fees in order to circulate.

What in the flying fuck?"
">BUT they want to tax very basic products like coffee, eggs, milk

no, that was taken down from the reform text in the very first days, like a week before the street protests started."
By how much things will get more expensive?
"For what I understand, there was an attemted tax reform, that was very poorly implemented and would affect the poor a lot at a time unemployment is high, and allthough most people agree its necesary to have such reforms, they dislike how corrupt the government is, and how little of those taxes benefit the common people. So the protests begun, and they escalated quickly, some protestors and police have died, mostly the former, which has angered people even more"
">or is it like Portland Oregon where the protests are only 1-2 city blocks?

yes, and some road blocks."
"It's very unlikely. A lot of social/political actors would have to converge for that to happen as long as the military falls into line with the status quo there is no immediate pressure for him.

Centro Democratico keeps silently distancing from him. At the very least politically he's done after his term."
There is no re-election so it would be kind of pointless
No he has friends in high places
"definitely not, not a chance."
"Mr Duque is weak politically—unlike his predecessors, he does not have a stable majority coalition in Congress. Even his mentor, former president Alvaro Uribe, has distanced himself from Mr Duque; he was one of the first to speak against the bill. The president has surrounded himself with yes-men, which helps explain why he seems out of touch with many Colombians. Indeed, since the protests started he has given the impression that he hadn’t even read the bill. He seemed surprised to learn about some of its VAT measures and left Mr Carrasquilla and another minister to defend the reform.

Governing will become even harder for Mr Duque. His term ends in August 2022 and he is already seen as a lame duck. Opposition politicians feel emboldened. Gustavo Petro, a left-winger, is gaining momentum in the polls. He lost against Mr Duque in the presidential elections of 2018, but is planning to run again next year. He has proposed that the central bank print more money to deal with the aftermath of the pandemic, and has praised the late Hugo Chávez, the despotic socialist who set Venezuela on the path to ruin. Instead of a bold tax reform, Mr Duque’s legacy may instead be ensuring that Colombia gets its first socialist president."
[deleted]
"It would be pointless, next in line if Duque were to resign are his VP, Marta Lucía Ramírez (who is absolutely fucking useless) and President of the Congress (Arturo Char) who might be an even bigger crook than Duque (Google the Char family). No real change would be seen in that department with the current scenario 

And, even if we, somehow, managed to prop up a Mujica-Merkel-FDR-Mandela hybrid (you get the idea) as president, we'd still have the same crooked, rotten congress who would absolutely pull out all the stops whenever said president wanted to do something that doesn't benefit them

And, as someone a couple comments further down said, the economic consequences for the country would be massive were Duque to step down. Even if he's a shit president (IMO he makes a rather strong case for worst president in our history), investors and international markets would rather have him there than have a ""headless"" state borrowing money and shit."
"That's their aim right now, without asking themselves about how much it will affect Colombia's fundamentals (credit rating, sovereign debt rates, CDS points, currency exchange rate, inflation rate, ...)

Being foreign to economics/finance concepts doesn't make anyone immune to them, but Colombians tend to think that ignoring/overlooking concepts grants a pass from them."
Oh this is messed up!
I fear that too. I am sorry.
I also expect this to boost Petro's popularity
"Both political sides agree tax reform is necessary. 

An alternative Petro suggested was printing more money."
"It's necessary, the issue is the distribution of the taxation and the exemptions that don't disappear."
"El alcalde influencer joven y chévere salió igualito a los demás políticos, ¿quién lo diría?"
"There's  a ""Comite del Paro"" who is made up of several Unions and usually they are the ones who call for paros in Colombia, when this started as a protest for the tax reform they were the ones who called for it.

This paro has been different. Much more people have gone to the streets than before and the escalation and violence in the cities has been unprecedented in many ways, especially in Cali. In a sense it's ""new ground"" for Colombia as far protesting go.

As the days have passed  and the protesta have taken a new form beyond the tax reform, there's s huge gap between the original comite del Paro and the people protesting. Simply put if they said ""The paro is over"" Most people on the streets would continue. It's a big problem right now.

The government's usual scapegoat is to say there's ""infiltrados"" from the guerrillas. Always is. Could they be? Maybe. Are they the ones leading the protests and are they a big majority? I don't think so. 

As for political bias. Clearly it's people who are tired of Duque and are antiuribistas. That is true. Like you are saying many people are accusing left wing candidates like Petro of being instigators and using the protest for personal gain. Maybe he will. But at this stage most people really are not thinking about Petro when they are going out there. If Petro said today ""we have to stop"". People wouldn't stop either."
"From a distance, it looks like it has transitioned to opposition against the brutality that the tax protesters suffered. I have read there are calls to disband the anti-riot squads responsible for the deaths, and general calls for government officials to resign."
"What u/boneyfingers said. But also there are other incoming reforms like healthcare, labour and pension reform.

Just read 2 days ago an academic analysis of the proposed healthcare reform is a clusterfuck. It will make the current healthcare system more akin to the US."
"They're far from over, showcasing the real scope of things."
"Perhaps, poor countries cannot afford coronavirus lockdowns, so here are the consequences. More political disarray in the third world."
"A couple years ago more countries protested, so no i doubt it"
"May God spare us from another of those ""revolutions"""
"Taking into account what Arab Spring brought forth, please no."
"No, I don't think so."
The Colombian left trying to strike another Chile. At least Chile had its finances and institutions in a better shape. This mob will end up ruling over debris.
"""Petro supporters""

This narrative NEEDS to stop. This went beyond elections a long time ago. Petro or not, tax reform or not. People are tired of Duque. That's undeniable, Petro is the last thing on the minds of the people on the streets."
Tax Reform was indeed needed. No one is denying that. The Problem is the way he and his government are trying to execute it. Its blatantly disorganized. They definately didn't think this thought as they glossed over  the possible out comes of such a high and drastic tax reform and how it could lead to bigger issues.
"After cutting taxes for the richest people in the last tax reform. I dislike Petro a lot but that ""guerrillero mamerto"" attitude towards anything to the left of extreme right is dumb and propagandistic."
"Why the fuck is it that people keep blaming the left and Petro for everything wrong with the country but those in power and that are governing ya, and that have been in power for as long as I can remember, are all from the far-right? Can you explain this please?"
"Usually we agree, this time we don't.

No, the tax reform wasn't needed. What Colombia (and most of Latin America) needs is a massive and drastic reduction of public spending.

Then, and only then, the tax systems could be reviewed.

It's time to stop feeding useless bureaucrats."
"Sorely needed by whom? the reform was an absolute disaster, that would defund the arts.

I'm not like a super good economist, but in a moment like this you want to reduce taxes and increase spending in projects that puts more money in people's hands. The tax reform was a tool of opression, not revenue."
"Yup, I wonder what the reaction would have been if instead the government didn't bother to do anything against the pandemic and our hospitals had run out of supplies, also I can imagine the outrage if we hadn't bought any  vaccines by now. People just don't seem to understand we're a poor country, and that means we're going to have a hard time funding the response to an emergency as big as this one."
"That tax reform was so aligned with wealth redistribution that lefties went mad to the idea of not being them doing the reform; and politicians (some of them soon-to-be retirees) went mad to the idea of them paying more taxes.

Duque tried to do a Bismarck without a Prussian army."
"Duque Macri y Piñera son socialdemócratas?

El man está citando los objetivos del M-19 de hace 30 AÑOS como si fueran las propuestas de alguien en 2021?

No pude seguir el video con tanta estupidez de salida. Esta desinformando muchísimo."

"I get you. Our president said that the fault of the second wave  lies (this time) in doctors because they... did their job and treated other illness. At the time people defended CFK when she said basically that diabetics are wealthy fatties.

"It looks like it will affect those with lower income much more than those with higher income. Not only because of the reduction of exempted income, but also because VAT, due to its nature, weighs more heavily on those with lower income."

Why is the government in such dire need for money?
">They are all terrible 

why? explain us, please.

but it pressume it would be hard to explain for you something that doesn't exist. There isn't any pension reform formulated, nor there is any labour reform. And the healthcare ""reform"" is the application of several laws already approved.

but explain your points of view."
"I am a bit out of the loop, but compared to even their neighbors Colombia's labor market seems liberal (perhaps there are things I am unaware of that can be improved but it seems decent as is). On pension reform it seems like outside Chilean type privatization, I don't see how that can be liberalized anymore as it is a market based plan. On healthcare I am out of the loop. From the little I gathered it reminds me of the HMO act in the US that was more than useless. Again I am not on the ground but that is what I can gather, correct me if I am wrong."
">Pensions would have been taxed, too. 

Pensions over 2000 USD or so."
">One of the longest lockdowns in the world has emptied wallets and sapped morale. Since last year 2.8m people have fallen into extreme poverty. More than 500,000 businesses have closed.

I've been against lockdowns for one year exactly for this very same reason. I knew the economic consequences would be terrible, especially for poor countries. I was called names and people (on this very same subreddit) made fun of me.

Now we see the consequences.

The economy cannot just be shut down. It can't. Even after natural disasters the first thing people do is to try to get the systems back so people can work. People need to produce and the cash flow cannot be interrupted. Lockdowns are something so absurd that not even the craziest economic theories propose something like that.

History will be written and lockdowns will be described as what they really were: one of the biggest economic mistakes in history."
"Holy, stay safe"
What's so bad about such tax reform?
"Do you believe it could escalate farther than chile did, or would the issues tame before that?"
"I can understand what you mean by tension in families. The political situation in the U.S. isn’t like the situation in Colombia, but we definitely have that generational/political divide. I feel that same tension with many of my relatives.

I hope you’re right and that some changes come out of this. I hope things stay well with your family, too."
"Tell me about it. One of my uncles shared an article about the dissipated molecular revolution theory going around in the family group chat and all of my cousins had a few choice words which caused a family fight in the group chat lol, and my dad and I got into a small discussion yesterday because he supports the government and always tried to find a reason to defend them. It blows my mind."
"I don't know Josue. I agree that social networks usually make things appear bigger, nevertheless, I have to say that there is enough material to say that this is a big moment. Regarding your comment that there isn't many people in the streets and that a good part of them belong to unions, I disagree. What I've seen, been a witness myself, is that more than half is regular people, simply protesting for what they believe it is wrong with our country (whatever that is). Many people are protesting because of this frustration, the anger against a government who has not performed its duties well. I don't know where you stand in the situation, but I believe things might escalate even more, both in protests and in politics. 
In protests: Police brutality will continue and people will continue protesting. We are sick of the way police behaves in this country. How many people will protest? I don't know. Initially I thought that considering the risk you take when you protest with the police + covid less people would be willing to do it. What I've seen is many people going out and protest, considering the risk, because they believe the moment requires it. 
Politics. This is a very complicated one. I'll just say that multiple people are trying to take advantage of the situation. Many governors and mayors have shown their true face. It has been clear the executive branch has no control over police or military unless their interests are aligned. Whatever happens politically might not be the best option possible, but I don't see things changing (for better or worse) any other way."
So I take it there haven’t been any large demonstrations in your neighborhood?
What trend are you referring to here? The demonstrations?
"I don't remember the last year where we did not have a tax hike tbh but that's on us, if you guys disagree with the tax hike you are probably right"
">Colombians are not taxed, very few people pays taxes.

Nearly every Colombian pays taxes in some form of other. Do you buy beer? Aguardiente? You pay a tax for it. Buy anything outside certain kinds of food? Most of that is taxed with a 19% Value-Added-Tax or VAT, also known as the. IVA.

Do you eat at a restaurant or buy bread at a bakery (you wouldn't be a real proper Colombian if you didn't do the later) you pay a 8% consumption tax.

Do you have cell-phone or internet service? There is another consumption tax on that of 8%.

Not to mention the taxes on any money you transfer via bank, cuatro por mil? Ever heard of it? You pay 4 pesos for every 1000 pesos on any kind of financial transaction. This tax was passed in 1998 and supposed to be temporary, but they kept it around forever because congress knows that there's nothing like a good tax. Over time most Colombians have been made exempt from this tax, but most businesses still have to pay it. And since it's a tax on financial transactions that tax can filter down to you.

And then we approach taxes paid by people who are officially employed. Yes, only about 50% of people have official jobs in Colombia, and that number is now way less since the pandemic did away with a bunch of them, but 50% of a country is still a lot of people. These are your typical ""payroll taxes"" as we understand them in the US. Those are broken down into two categories for individuals (and more for businesses but we can look at that later) which are healthcare and pension and equal 4% each which means official employees pay a 8% tax on their income. Healthcare is actually not a bad deal because that covers your health insurance, although EPS's are a useless nightmare a lot of the time, it's still a tax payment though. Pensions on the other hand require a ridiculous amount of weeks (1300 or 25 years of non-stop work compared to the US's 10)  to pay into to get benefits which is why nearly 80% of people who have official jobs, never actually qualify for pensions. Pensions as structured in Colombia are useless and for 80% of people that tax is a waste. Pensions exist for the rich and the pension tax is a regressive tax moving money away from poor people to the rich. That's why Pensions in Colombia have ridiculously high payouts.

Then we could get into the fact that there are [another 25% of taxes on income that employers have to pay](https://papayaglobal.com/countrypedia/country/colombia/?utm_term=&utm_campaign=US-Search-DSA-Countrypedia-DesktopAndMobile-M2F&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_acc=9309967209&hsa_cam=12441225283&hsa_grp=119172009780&hsa_ad=501571274138&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=dsa-1186009938853&hsa_kw=&hsa_mt=b&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gclid=Cj0KCQjwp86EBhD7ARIsAFkgakg81Q1RmQS0jC1Vh-fvyjibyiVGS_2FF2zX7Pmsd3UzMohzd6JId4EaAjpeEALw_wcB). Some of these are very important, medical tax, cesantias (factored as labour risk on the sheet) being funds that go into an account you can access if you are fired, and family compensation funds. But once again that 12% going into pensions is useless for most people with how the system is set up. And while all these benefits are extremely important, the high amount of taxes that need to be paid by companies do depress wages.

And that's just some of the taxes that most Colombians do end up paying. We're not even broaching issues like gas taxes (how do you think food gets to your local grocery anyways?), or property taxes (a good amount of Colombians do own homes naturally it's a minority, but those folks do have to pay something naturally), or the other multitude of taxes that exist in thee country.

While yes, most Colombians do not pay income taxes, they do pay some kind of tax somewhere at some point. And given how little most of them make, the amount they do pay can be quite significant.

&#x200B;

> To use road tolls as an example of people paying taxes is silly, most Colombians don't own a car, even middle class Colombians.

Do you buy goods that have ever been transported from one city to another?  Use public transport to travel between two cities? You've spent quite a bit of money on a tolls at that point in time, even though you don't seem to realize it. There's even a toll road between Cali and the airport at Palmira, for example, so if you ever got to fly out of Cali, you'll be paying into that toll.

[The road to the Llanos from Bogota is a famous example. It's controlled by Colombia's richest ogliarch.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZnQKTRFeJc) Most of the food that comes into Bogota comes from this region as does a lot of the petroleum and other important goods. The entire set up costs Colombian's millions of our national taxes to build, and we pay ridiculous fees on it to further pad the pocket of Carlos Sarmiento, while the costs of goods only go up due to his greed. Colombian's can't afford higher food costs because a billionaire wants to get richer.

As for your qualification that most Colombians don't own a car, that is true, but the concept that most middle class Colombians don't own one, just factually isn't true. It only makes sense if your qualification for what a middle class Colombian is is very, very low and doesn't include Taxi-Drivers, Truck Drivers of the multitudes of people who drive people around on Uber and InDriver or informal ""pirate"" transportation such as seen around the portal to the sea in Cali, for example.

Let's get into the nitty gritty, [Colombia's qualifier (per the DANE, the official statistics entity of the Colombian government) for ""Middle Class"" is income between $653,781($180) and $3,500,000 ($972) pesos a month.](https://forbes.co/2021/05/06/economia-y-finanzas/personas-con-ingresos-entre-653-781-y-35-millones-al-mes-son-clase-media/) Take into account the Colombian minimum wage is $908,526 ($250). So yes, according to the Government, people making less than minimum wage in Colombia are ""Middle Class""

Let me try to unpack how absurd that notion is. You can not fucking live on 650 thousand pesos a month in Colombia. In most cities you can not even pay rent with 650 thousand pesos a month in Colombia. No one who makes that much money in Colombia qualifies as any kind of middle class. This just further demonstrates how out of touch this entire administration is with reality. Maybe this has something to do with [this gomelo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmqo94UsKqw) being Duque's head of the DANE (ey marica).

But if you earn over 2 million pesos a month, you can quite possibly afford a car in Colombia. I know people who earn a bit over 1 million who own cars. You must keep in mind that cars in Colombia are an investment used to generate income and act as something that allows class mobility and higher incomes. Effectively just owning a car allows one access to the middle class. For me it's almost difficult too qualify someone as middle class without some level of car ownership.

So yeah, while many Colombians do not own car, the fact that the Colombian vision of middle class is this fucking poor points to the massive levels of inequality and poverty in the country that have only been worsened by Neoliberal vultures and out of touch Ogliarchs like Duque and Santos.

&#x200B;

>corruption is not just some rich people and high profile politicians stealing money, it has much, much deeper roots. And it's much more complex than just people taking off money from your pocket.

Sure it does, but the corruption that hurts the Colombian people the most is this corruption and it is all interconnected culturally with all forms of other corruption. People learn from their role models. And the actions leadership takes reverberates through society.

&#x200B;

>Gilberto Tobón is a pretty bad analyst, he's just a youtube influencer, with political interests and his speech is extremely simplistic. He's not an expert on these subjects.

Who would you qualify as a good analyst on Colombian politics then? Tobon barely has a youtube following. If anything he's a facebook influencer, but he's more of a television journalist. Not an actual youtube influencer like Pewdiepie."
"I don't think people were opposing that. The problem was with how far reaching it was and how it would affect the already struggling middle and lower class.

I highly doubt people would be out there protesting like they did in the beginning if this new tax bill was reasonable and not just because they want to throw the middle finger at duque.

Edit: Just want to mention that I'm all for Tax reform the country needs it especially now"
"Yeah, that peace treaty was far from perfect, but the only other realistic option was to continue fighting them (a strategy that was employed for 50 or so years and didn't quite work)"
"Who acts like that?🤔 

Pretty much everyone is condemning the Violence"
"Just saw a video of a person jogging, stopping for a moment and getting shot in the stomach by police in bikes as they drive away and the rest of the posse ignores him as he rolls around.

So to answer: probably any and by the police."
"No, certain things are exempt from VAT taxes if they're regarded as basic necessity."
"Some items are declared as VAT exempted or with a lower VAT tax. For some of those products, they would go from 0% or 5% VAT to 19%."
"Misinformation, nothing more."
"If you had something that $2000 right now, it will cost 20% more: $2500. Let's say milk for the whole week: $12 000, now it will cost:.     $14 400. 

So that's for milk only, but if you want to buy any other milk based product it's price will rice accordingly. All basic products of consumption would get taxed, except for: sugary products. Why? Because many landowners from the Cauca Valley (the worst of the worst) depend on sugar cane production. Many big Colombian enterprises produce things like fizzy drinks, lollies, etc. That won't get taxed, but eggs, milk, coffee, chocolate, etc. will be taxed.

Petrol will also be more expensive too. So everything that has to be transported, will be more expensive.

Whether if it gets more expensive or not depends on what products have VAT already and what products don't. Some only have a VAT of 5%, but that will change with this reform.

This is thanks to an economic policy of extractivism that only relies on commodities to sustain it's whole economy. The government doesn't mind if the COP gets cheaper and cheaper, because we can export cheap oil overseas, but they won't invest in education or the peasantry. That combined with the rising violence in the outback... Well... It seems the government only cares about keeping its profit going and that is the profit of landowners and politicians. We live in a feudal system ruled by physiochrats."
">At the very least politically he's done after his term.

Man, you never know. Look at Pastrana."
That was the best Santos' legacy alongside the peace accords.
So you think the oversized outlash to this current bad president will lead to even worse one?
That's what I saw when I was buying gas with my dad for the motorcycle. Honestly I can't give a good impression from either the police or the rioters at this point.
Oh god Petro shut the fuck up
Is there an island of misfit politicians? The US has a few it needs to send :D /
That will cause inflation right?
"No me extraña. Además, habla como si la inseguridad no fuera un problema desde hace tiempo sino que no hizo un jopo nunca sobre eso. Más bien la pandemia ayudó a que se redujera la criminalidad."

What's the goal now?

My family is all poor. We lived in the worst parts of town. I was upset about it at first. Until I saw all the social funding it would bring.
"Yeah, for some reason people keep blaming Petro for everything that happens in the country. These people act like everything that isn't their political ideology is Petro, communism and socialism."
"Remind me where were the massive riots when Santos announced the increase in the VAT/IVA from 16% to 19% just to enter the OECD.

It's not about the taxes anymore, it never was solely about the taxes."
">This went beyond elections a long time ago.

The rioting and demonstrations started right after 2018 elections and we'll have elections in less than a year so IT IS about elections. Do not try to mislead people."
The proposed reform raised taxes on the wealthiest Colombians the most.
"?

the last reform raised the tax of the higher ""patrimonios"", ""dividendos"" and ""rentas"". it was a reform aimed at lowering the tax of bussiness, and increasing the tax of (rich) people."
"Colombia does need a tax reform, not the one that was taken down, but it really needs one. The tax reform should include cuts in public spending related to ""funcionamiento del Estado"".

The Government has a strong deficit, we need to cover what we have spent because of the pandemic and what we will need to spend in the next years. Our credit rate is endangered, a credit rate downgrade will be much more expensive for the country. I heard it would cost us *20 billones de pesos* (almost 6 billion USD) more every year, because of new interest rates etc."
"The COVID crisis demands more revenue to pay for the vaccination program and to keep the subsidized health system running.

In spite you being right about excessive government spending (the Duque cabinet is full of every entitled technocrat you can find) the COVID crisis is still there over almost every aspect of Colombia's life"
"During a pandemic whether or not there is a lockdown you need to be able to afford medicinal supplies, beds, and infrastructure (not including vaccines). 

The government either needs money, or they are going to face much harsher issues."
"Tool of oppression? Lmao 

The tax reform was needed to fund the social spending for the working classes and the hospitals."
"Exactly, the main thing I would attribute to the protests are social media and trends. When asking on the street, the great majority (you would be impressed) Will respond unironically ""Uribe Paraco"" or ""Duque chao"". Most of the people aren't even affected by the Bill (As Estratos 1,2,3 don't have any increases whatsoever, even more these estratos get more indirect subsidies by the government in the public bills proyects, which Estratos 4-6 subsidise Estratos 1-3) Most of these people are going out for the trend and because they have nothing else to do. If they want to change the country, be reasonable, and not ask for less taxes and more subsidies. Colombia has no money, and we're getting more and more in debt. The dollar is skyrocketing. Cities are having food shortages, hundreds of millions of pesos are being lost every hour in people not working and blockades around the country. Duque has to scramble the military, as the people have destroyed way too much, and if there is no intervention from the military now, it may be too late until the country is unrepairable. A protest is just a day and sends a clear and concise message, this is becoming young people requesting outrageous demands, and using this as a way to skip off their responsabilities, as the amount of damage they are doing by protesting are making their demands even harder to put into order, as the government has to restore our country before doing anything else. You don't ""fix"" a country by destroying its public transport, or its Capitol, or hundred's of entrepenours bussiness. Shown exactly to perfection yesterday when Transmilenio was skipping tens of stations vandalized and destroyed by the same protestors a few days ago. And then they blame the government. The people of Colombia do not know what is best for Colombia, we live in a poor, stupid, and undeveloped country. Porfavor que Colombia no caiga en el Socialismo y Comunismo ya que no hay mas alternativa al Uribismo. Dios nos salve"
"Poverty is one thing, but inquality tends to compound the difficulties caused by it. There seems to be a correlation between a country's Gini coefficient and its infection rates."
We aren’t a poor country though. We are an upper middle-income country. The issue here is the extreme inequality and the extreme corruption and mishandling of funds. Let us not forget how many billions are lost in corruption every year.
"Exactly. I don’t understand these people calling for wealth inequality. Yes, the VAT would have increased for working class. But the social spending would have provided much more relief for them, and even taking several people out of poverty."
"No se sobre Duque y Piñera pero Macri fue socialdemócrata; desarrollista, intervencionista, aumentó el tamaño del estado, aumentó impuestos y tarifas, mantuvo todo lo público y no privatizó nada realmente, tomó deuda y causo inflación, terminó aplicando cepo cambiario de nuevo, añadió más regulaciones para proteger a los trabajadores y dañar a los inversores y la lista sigue.

Por el otro lado su partido ha sido el artífice de cosas como la ley de alquileres que aumentó los impuestos y congeló precios para los que alquilan y al final salió como el orto porque los precios de los alquileres subieron y se cagaron los inquilinos y los propietarios. También han presentado otras leyes regulatorias y de índole socialdemócrata-socialista.

De nuevo, sobre Duque y Piñera no tengo idea, pero Macri no fue de centro-izquierda y la mayoría te dirían lo mismo. Después lo del M-19; según tengo entendido no existe hace 20 años esa guerrilla pero supongo que lo que critica es que el tipo haya estado en una guerrilla de índole terrorista y que sea un candidato presidencial, pero francamente esto es latinoamerica y acá en Argentina la mitad del gobierno actual fueron Montoneros, del ERP o de otro grupo guerrillero. En Perú uno de los candidatos también fue miembro de una guerrilla comunista. Ya ni siquiera es sorprendente."
Well i hope that goes great for you and you get paid so much money you can go vacationing again

"there is no Uribistas to get mad at here, only furious petristas and ""antiuribistas"" spewing fake news and their usual self righteousness and virtue signaling.

On reddit, Uribistas are almost non-existant. And for some reason I just despise him, I don't care about their idiotic opinions, it's just like an old guy who got stuck in the past, no one cares about him. But there's something about ""Antiuribistas"" and how profoundly hypocritical and false they are, that bothers me."
How it's petro's fault?
"To be honest, what makes these protests in Colombia particular is not the protests themselves, but the brutal reaction by authorities. As a Colombian, we have protests every year in similar scale and eventually you kind of grow tired of them, as in you think ""not again, this never really achieves anything..."" but this year the killings have been outrageous. ITT, you can see some other guy saying ""They haven't killed 40 people, they have killed 19!"" How is that any better?! There's an obnoxious amount of video evidence that the police are just going for blood. No amount of murders are warranted nor necessary."

The source is outdated, 5 cops and 17 protesters. But the real issue with the protesters is how they've left cities without food and everyone without the ability to move or go to work. They left people for days in their cars without being able to leave, or do anything."
"It wasn't going to be like that because there was also an income tax extension, so people from 2,8 million to 4 million would pay 66 thousand pesos a year, 4 to 7 million 1,2 million a year, and increasing. There was a progressive tax alongside the VAT extension. Plus new taxes on patrimony and other very OECD things.

The poor also were going to have VAT rebates and a solidarity wage, which was going to be increased in sum and in number of people."
"Trickle down economics are still all the rage in all Latin America, it seems."
"No. The proposed reform affects the wealthiest the most. Even the wealthy supporters of President Duque are upset.

VAT wasn’t the only increase."
"Would you care to read more carefully what I've wrote?

> Some low earning people would be eligible to VAT refunding."
"Nah. This guy has it wrong (the OP). The VAT is already 19% and has been for a couple of years, they were thinking of extending it to other products, though, which is what got taken down."
"The 16% is absurd anyway, the fucking government has been increasing the price of gas and things for years and years with stupid excuses and always calling it temporary. 

There was a day where the dollar would hover at 1k pesos, then everyone became super escandalized when it reached 2k, now it lives between 3 and 4 and nobody bats an eye.

"I'd say it's a combination of many factors, some of them being the expansion of bureaucracy, the expansion of welfare due the pandemic, the subsidizing of health and basic services and the vaccination program."

I will only explain to you the health reform, which is the one I have more knowledge of as I am currently under medical training and have been discussing it with some collegues.

[http://leyes.senado.gov.co/proyectos/images/documentos/Textos%20Radicados/proyectos%20de%20ley/2020%20-%202021/PL%20010-20%20Derecho%20Fundamental%20a%20la%20Salud.pdf](http://leyes.senado.gov.co/proyectos/images/documentos/Textos%20Radicados/proyectos%20de%20ley/2020%20-%202021/PL%20010-20%20Derecho%20Fundamental%20a%20la%20Salud.pdf)

&#x200B;

I will point out some of the worst points:

**Capítulo 3, Artículo 11, Parágrafo 4** \-  . *The people must be responsible of following the instructions of ""autocare"" given by the ""AS"", be it through the medical personnel or through the health promotion guidelines. The people must be on time for appointments and adhere themselves to the recommendations of treatment and care*.

Nice! Isn't it? the problem is that behind this paragraph and many others they are putting a paywall, so if you for some reason are considered irresponsible by the AS (and such judgment will be left to the AS -what a stupid bullshit-) you will be charged more.

On the next paragraph you will see it. The biggest issue with this is that it will happen in the most unequal country of latin america and one of the most corrupt in the world. Now you should see that this is not something made to ecourage responsability, is just a way of making the poor more poor and giving more money to the EPS or AS.

**Capítulo 4, Artículo 16, Parágrafo 1** \- THIS ONE WAS MODIFIED, but originally provided more autonomy and power to the EPSs (AS), a terrible idea considering the CARTELS in contracts regarding supplies and other stuff.

&#x200B;

**Capítulo 4, Artículo 17** \- This is probably the worst, it is supposedly out of the discussion already but it is still showing in the official website of the senate so I will include it here. This article seeks for the depuration of the insurability given by the AS, which means that the Basic Plan of Healthcare will see the number of diseases and conditions covered by it reduced in God knows what and how much.

**Capítulo 4, Artículo 21, Parágrafo 2** \- Imposes new limitations to join the ""RS - or  subsidized regime"", specially for those that are unemployed (something that I find terrible if you take into account the effects of the pandemic in out economy). More people will be left without healthcare.

**Capítulo 5, Artículo 24** \- THIS ONE WAS MODIFIED, originally wanted to provide assistance only during the course of illness, something that doesn't make sense, since health is more of a matter of prevention. You don't want a healthcare system that only wants to cure or treat. (I am seriously surprised this was even considered).

Some of these had been modified but I put them here to show how cynic this government is.

&#x200B;

Now I could continue pointing out other elements regarding the health care workers, the distribution of ""residency quotas"", the practical medical training autonomy of the IPS, the liquidation of ESE or public hospitals and so on.

I believe this should be enough for now. At this point I can't imagine that you stated that there is almost nothing new, when they are literally flipping everything over. **There is not a single element of the Healthcare system not touched by this**, and you have the audacity to say it is ""something that already existed"".

I confess I don't know much of the pensional reform and the labour reform, but reading the health reform and the tributary reform, I BELIEVE there is a bigger chance for the others to exist than not.

&#x200B;

EDIT: STILL CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DID NOT READ THE REFORM BY YOUR OWN. I didn't give you a link to the colombian medical academy analysis or to any other site that made summaries because I wanted to discuss it with you under our own udnerstanding (because you sounded like you did it by yourself) what a disappointment."
"How in the hell the supression of regimenes subsidiado and contributivo for them to be merged into only one regime is something that has been approved? when was it approved? what's the law number? 

&#x200B;

Also the ""autocuidado"" part, when was it approved? when did the law said that basically if EPS just go and say ""well yeah, you didnt take care of yourself so tough luck buddy we gonna charge you extra"" it can be actually legal and not a cause of, for example, an acción de tutela in order to exempt people for that?

&#x200B;

Explain it to me because I'm at a loss."
"Not true.

Combined with fiscal policy, lockdowns work extremely well. The whole reason is to avoid a collapse in a country's health system. 

No serious economist is going to undermine the severity of the economic consequences of a lockdown, which is why it should be coupled with a fiscal policy.

Unfortunately, Colombia wants to start an austerity measure, i.e raising taxes, in the middle of a recession, which is incredibly dangerous. 

Also, lockdowns are supposed to last 2-3 months. They concentrate the economic damage in those months, ameliorated with fiscal policy. Instead, the situation you have in many countries in South America is a haphazardly attempt of a lockdown, combined with a lackluster spending by government authorities. This creates a situation in which the economic damage of the pandemic is spread over the whole year while poverty ensues. 

It is true many countries in South America had already structural problems, particulary after 2014. We, as a group of countries, are still moving, and suffering, from policies such as austerity measures as a solution to a recession. 

Also, if you think 100% of the economic problems in the ongoing recession, with the official start date of March 2020, is exclusively because of the pandemic, you are wrong."
It takes from those who are barely scraping by instead of from those who have wayyyyyy too much
i mean we've been in a civil war for the past 60+  years sooo yea this is gonna get uglier
"If I'm being honest, I really don't know. There's so much uncertainty that I believe anything could happen. I think the possibility that it gets way worse exists, as I know the things this government's capable of, but I really can't predict what will happen."
"well, at least that's the situation in my hometown, cab drivers and truck drivers blocking roads. and I live in a fairly left leaning city, hometown of Gustavo Petro. It was one of the few municipalities in Central Eastern Colombia where Petro got more votes than Duque.

Ironically I had to go to the first day of protests, and all I saw there was teenagers and union workers, very few people over 22 y.o.

From what I gather from the news, the situation in Bogota now is the same, road blockades from ""transportadores y camioneros"", concentrated in a few strategic spots. 

so, some people are angsty and frustrated... so? Everyone is, for many different reasons. Uribistas can be angry and frustrated too, they can take the streets too and there are millions of them. Who will we obey? the ones who shout the loudest? the ones who make the most noise? I don't think it's about that. It's not about some people in the street with their false righteousness shouting that Duque is a pig and everyone who doesn't think like they do are ""paracos"". It has to be about arguments, it has to be about reaching some kind of collective agreements, based on respecting each other's way of thinking. But that is far from what is currently happening."
"Not in the whole city, tonight it was just 300 hundred people or so marching in the city center. Pretty much all of them were aged 15-22. Very little for a city of 150k people. And even considering this town tends to be much more left leaning than many others in Colombia. Gustavo Petro grew up here and lived here until he was 30 or so."
Yes.
"The problem with Colombia is that these tax hikes needed to happen for everyone, but they only happened for people (low-mid-high classes), not for top companies. And that the measures do not fix structural issues in the society.

Let me illustrate with an example: Former minister Carrasquilla, who quitted yesterday, goes on media saying this:

https://www.semana.com/economia/macroeconomia/articulo/colombia-tiene-caja-para-seis-o-siete-semanas-alberto-carrasquilla/202152/

We need about COP 30 trillions. Now check this:

http://www.elnuevodia.com.co/nuevodia/opinion/columnistas/dario-ortiz/465200-ali-baba-y-los-40-billones

COP 50-90 trillions lost per year due to corruption.But the solution is to tax people more. A few days later this year, the government announces:

https://www.elquindiano.com/noticia/26201/reforma-tributaria-para-financiar-la-guerra

$14 trillion to buy air superiority fighters from the US. But we still need $30 trillion because there is reputedly no money."
The hero we need.
At this point they could be protesting as wealth tax and you guys would still support it
"So it was either an eternal war or a peace treaty, uh? I swear to god, Latin American politics are fucking depressing, almost every country in the region has former terrorists as politicians."
Talk to a rich right-wing Colombian and you’ll hear some crazy shit
"You'd be surprised mate

Maybe it's not THAT prominent in social media (eg. Instagram) as it is mostly populated by younger people (who mostly tend to be against police brutality and/or the current government)

But if you were to go into Facebook (which has a bit of a reputation as an ""old people"" social network) or WhatsApp group chats for example, you'll find plenty of people justifying the government and the killing of demonstrators, reducing all of them to mere vandals/criminals (which isn't the case obviously)"
"every death so far has been under different circumstances, check the news and the reports from Defensoría del Pueblo, HRW and other organizations.

even at least two cops have been killed, one was stabbed to death while trying to prevent a looting."
"every death so far has been under different circumstances, check the news and the reports from Defensoría del Pueblo, HRW and other organizations.

">For some of those products, they would go from 0% or 5% VAT to 19%.

No, again, this was not in the reform text. It was taken down."
">If you had something that $2000 right now, it will cost 20% more: $2500. Let's say milk for the whole week: $12 000, now it will cost:.     $14 400.

again, no. Not only because of what mauricio replied, but because the reform project didn't increase VAT from 16 to 19% as many people still claim, that was taken away from the text very early in the discussion.

something you describe would skyrocket inflation, would reduce a lot purchasing power of people and make consumption collapse... what you say doesn't even make sense. No goverment would shoot its foot that way (at least in the terms you described it)."
"You're misled.

That product costing $2000 already has a 19% VAT added to it.

Hiking the VAT to 20% will imply a recalculation:

After 19% VAT: $2000 --> Before 19% VAT: $1680,67 --> After 20% VAT: $2016,81

&#x200B;

The feudal system meme strikes again.

What u/hinoyminoy69 said
"Claro, el man podría no existir y daría lo mismo. Solamente aparece en Twitter para montar renders que probablemente nunca veremos en la vida real y para hablar del malecón."
Labour and pension are under construction. There's a draft for health. You can find news articles at the end of last year about reform priorities in the government.
They're demanding the president to step down and do elections in advance.
"Your English is quite good, which is a bit weird considering you said your family is very poor, but not poor enough to provide you with a good education in English?"
"But that's exactly the same petristas and the people who cringely call themselves ""antiuribistas"" do, call everyone who doesn't share their dogma ""uribista"", ""paraco"", ""aliado de los corruptos"". According to them anyone in Partido Verde is ""uribista"".

Seriously, this country is so stupid and sectarian. Haven't seen any informed, intelligent discussion about this reform so far."
It's because they need people like Petro to be the enemy because if he's not everything bad they say he is people will realize it's been them all along.
"Please read, I'm saying this is beyond taxes too. People are tired."
"That's right. Those ranting about ""they're going to tax me"" didn't bat an eye to the multiple tax reforms from 2010 to 2018.

It is partisan, mindless opposition and nothing more."
"My point being, the protests right now are not specifically about a single issue (the tax reform), or a future issue (elections). It's all of it."
"Yes, by killing all the funding to the arts? 

and which heahtlcare? the one being reformed to reduce access to health services by turning EPSs into aseguradoras?"
"I partially agree with you. Partially meaning that, while I think some people can be manipulated, I do think that most people are protesting because they are tired of paying taxes to useless bureaucrats.

>be reasonable, and not ask for less taxes and more subsidies

In my case, I want less taxes and way less subsidies."
">ya que no hay mas alternativa al Uribismo.

TBH, I was with you until this last bit. I agree Petro/Socialism/Communism are not the solution here, but c'mon, surely there's got to be a better option than the right wing that's run this country quite poorly over the last half a century or so"
">We aren’t a poor country though. We are an upper middle-income country. 

Those are just feel-good labels though. Colombia is a very poor country, our nominal GDP per capita is quite low at 5,753  USD.
 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal%29_per_capita?wprov=sfla1

Our government's [budget](https://www.senado.gov.co/index.php/prensa/lista-de-noticias/1663-presupuesto-general-de-la-nacion-para-el-2021-sera-de-314-billones-de-pesos) for 2021 is 81,566,053,000 USD. That is very low for a country of over 50 million people, Bill Gates alone is worth more than that. 

We need over a 100 million vaccines (2 for each person), [10 million](https://www.semana.com/economia/articulo/cuanto-gastara-colombia-en-la-vacuna-contra-el-coronavirus/308682/) units of the Pfizer vaccine (the cheapest one, I believe) cost 113,664,945 USD, so the total cost, assuming all the vaccines we acquire are from Pfizer, will amount to around 1,136,649,450 USD or ~1.4% of the government's budget just to buy vaccines, then you have to take into account the cost of the medical supplies needed to deal with this emergency (siringes, oxygen tanks, etc.) and the cost of safe transport and storage for those vaccines.

This pandemic is going to be quite expensive to deal with, and Colombia, as a poor country, is going to struggle big time to pay for all of this."
"There was also a VAT refund system within the original tax reform proposal; political agitators conveniently overlooked that.

I'm far from progressive or adept to permanent redistribution of wealth; but the ongoing COVID crisis demands that. What baffles me is that it's the so called ""progressives"" the ones opposing it and that's why I think that their problem is nothing short of not being them taking the awards from the implementation of such redistribution system.

That's why you, me and others receive downvotes, insults and not a single valid criticism of the tax reform project."
"Pues Petro se desmovilizó en un proceso de paz auspiciado por el gobierno colombiano de entonces. No debería importar. A Petro se lo recalcan porque es una forma fácil de atacarlo.

Desde entonces el M19 se volvio partido y eventualmente se separó. Los miembros han ido a parar a varios partidos (de izquierda y de derecha). Petro no es el único.

En el video habló como si alguien del M-19 estuviera en política proponiendo eso ""comunismo"" y eso es falso (Ya las FARC son otra cosa). Todo el video es un bait horrible para poner el miedo rojo culo de siempre."

Good luck with that, hopefully no more deaths occur"
"I said Colombians were uneducated (it's true, PISA scores and many other studies show it) and sectarian people, I didn't call anyone from this sub an idiot.

or maybe you are right but that would mean like 95% of post on r/colombia should be reported and banned, for one, because pretty much all political posts on there are from lefties insulting what they clumsily call ""uribistas""."
Sounds a lot like what happened in Ecuador and Chile in 2019
"Yeah, I was just commenting based on what he was saying. But, nonetheless, lowering the value of exemption from the income tax during a pandemic makes it look bad.

I understand why it happens, because the same happens in Brazil: there are too many poor people and too few rich people, so if you try to only increase taxes on the rich it's not enough. But to try to push something like this with everything that is going seems like a bad move."
Refunds are a hell of a lot more obstructive for lower class people than exemption would be.
"Some low earning. Not all low earning. And VAT weighs heavily on the middle class as well, particularly the lower middle class, who is probably already suffering with the restrictions brought by the pandemic."
Complain all you can so you dont become us
do you prefer gas being subsidized? that would be regressive and benefit the car owners.
"Yeah no shit, we all are in the deep for covid you dumbass, yet you don't see stuff like this happening in other countries."

I don't need to elaborate further since many different articles (including that one) already make it much clearer than whatever I could write. what you wrote is extremely ""black and white"", simplistic arguments, and assuming things from prejudices (hurr the government will rob more, we can't make reforms because we are too corrupt, the privates ar evil and will take advantage on us!!!) based on things that aren't even in the text."

"I agree with much of what you said, but lockdowns were never supposed to last this long. Lockdowns are an emergency, short-term measure while governments set up a test-trace-isolate system, which is the only thing that can truly suppress the pandemic. This is the only strategy that has worked in containing virus spread. Lockdowns should last at most a few weeks."
">Also, if you think 100% of the economic problems in the ongoing recession, with the official start date of March 2020, is exclusively because of the pandemic, you are wrong.

I never said lockdowns created our problems. I am saying lockdowns **worsened** our problems.

>from policies such as austerity measures as a solution to a recession. 

Why do Latin Americans always have to paint austerity as a bad word? Are we so used to spending without control that the thought of spending within our means is crazy?

Excessive public spending is neither healthy nor wise. I recognize cutting down public spending in a recession is not orthodox, but when do we start? Maybe it's the time for shock therapy.

>Combined with fiscal policy

Fiscal policy meaning debt and money printing? I'd rather not devalue my currency or get into more debt. 

>Unfortunately, Colombia wants to start an austerity measure, i.e raising taxes, in the middle of a recession, which is incredibly dangerous. 

Agree. That could actually have the opposite effect."
Based comment.
"Not even 15% of the Colombian population has been directly engaged into the Colombian conflict for you to mislabel it as a ""civil war""

A civil war clearly and violently divides a society but guess what? You or me could be riding a bus with a person we consider far opposite from our points of view yet we do not draw guns at each other. In a civil war we wouldn't even have a bus ride.

Part of finding the truth consists in naming the things properly, for what they truly are."
">as I know the things this government's capable of

Quit drama, man."
"yes, I agree with you. The way you said is the way is has to be, but it is also far from what is happening now. Hate, anger and frustration are being more important than arguments. This is at least the case for most people in the country, protesting or not. I'm personally guilty of the same thing. I'm trying to do better. 

I just want to add to anyone reading this who is not from Colombia that we have an additional problem here: lack of trust for one another. Even if we agree on certain things or in everything, we are always skeptical of the other part. Why? Sadly, our culture and history both as a country and as a society has been written by people who take advantage of their position. Sometimes is money, sometimes power, sometimes lives. 

I sincerely hope that some day we can change this attitude. It will take years, but we might get there. My only hope is to learn about countries that were and are able to change themselves. Most recently, I learned about South Africa. You can learn more here: https://www.dianauribe.fm/cronicas-de-viajes/viajeasudafricaii . You can also learn about Ruanda. If you are a Colombian, don't loose faith. Find what you can do from your end to build a better country for everyone and let's get to work!"
"No country has successfully closed all tax loopholes and eliminated all corruption. How are we going to do that in the very limited amount of time that happened during the covid crisis?

To replace aircraft that have been in service more than the 30 years of reliable service time. Several countries around the world are already putting their forces on high alert, including France, China, Taïwan, Russia, and others. One of those, Russia, literally violated our airspace with fighter bombers like a week ago, at the same time the Venezuelan minister of defense said any war would be fought in Colombian territory. Is it really so ridiculous for us to buy a couple of planes? When Taïwan said they were buying fighters from the US everyone here was in favor."
">So it was either an eternal war or a peace treaty, uh?

Pretty much, yeah

>I swear to god, Latin American politics are fucking depressing

They very much are. In fact, I'm sorry for this but living in LATAM altogether is pretty depressing now. I used to love the idea of staying here to work and try to help improve this country, but that possibility seems long gone. I gotta admit I'm warming up to the idea of just fucking off to Europe/North America as soon as I can and not looking back"

"Once again.This was a breaking point, it could have been the tax reform or the health reform. It's very evident the overarching problem is the government and how things are run."
Who gives a fuck about the arts? Besides Petro supporters and sociology students?
"Again, Colombia is not a “very poor country”. We are middle income. Obviously when compared to much richer countries, our budget seems quite low. But that’s because again... we are a middle income country. Not a rich country by any means. The truly poor countries have GDPs much, much lower than us. Not trying to argue here, just trying to clear this up."
Literally. It was very out of character for Duque to even propose such large social spending.

"Yes!

Lower income people have ""liquidity constraints"". That means, they can´t just ""borrow"" the money that the government will refund them, because they might not even have a bank account and have to go to usurers."
"Being middle class is not a pass for citizen duties.

Even more amid a world pandemic."
"Ya, definitely not for subsidies, but ther's a loooooot of space between overpaid gas and the inneficient oil industry, and subsidies.

>“Hoy en día el sistema de salud es un sistema de seguridad social que obliga al pago de una cotización obligatoria, eso se llama parafiscalidad. Esos son recursos públicos que se transfieren a las EPS por una Unidad de Pago por Capitación, UPC, que tiene destinación específica como recursos públicos para la prestación de los servicios de salud que se requieran, pueden ser preventivos, curativos, o de rehabilitación. Las EPS solo se pueden quedar con el 10% de la UPC para gastos administrativos o ingresos empresariales y el resto tiene que ir al pago de los servicios de sus afiliados. Eso no lo están haciendo así, nunca lo han hecho así, solo citemos el caso Saludcoop como ejemplo”.   
>  
>Entonces, agrega el médico Mario Hernández, “lo que está pasando en este proyecto de ley es que el Gobierno quiere darle un incentivo a las EPS para llamarlas aseguradoras y que se comporten como aseguradoras \[es decir, que se ocupen de la gestión del riesgo en salud\]. Pero ellas dicen ‘¡ah! Si usted me va a tratar como aseguradora y me va a poner un porcentaje de administración y el resto para servicios, entonces yo no le jalo. Porque si me va a tratar como una aseguradora, me tiene que transferir esos recursos como una póliza, como una póliza de seguro empresarial, igual que en cualquier empresa privada de seguros. Esa es la confusión que tiene ese proyecto de ley”.  
>  
>Explica Hernández que “incluso, el proyecto de ley, como es hecho a varias manos y con esa doble intencionalidad, no hablan de pólizas sino de ‘primas de aseguramiento’ y eso es lo que en el análisis de este proyecto crea una confusión terrible, porque la plata no es una prima de aseguramiento \[no son recursos privados\], en realidad son recursos públicos de destinación específica”.  
>  
>Hay que recordar que, de acuerdo con el [artículo 25 de la Ley 1751 de 2015](https://www.minsalud.gov.co/Normatividad_Nuevo/Ley%201751%20de%202015.pdf), los recursos públicos que financian la salud son inembargables, tienen destinación específica y no podrán ser dirigidos a fines diferentes a los previstos constitucional y legalmente.   
>  
>En efecto, en el artículo 22 del proyecto se precisa que “el Ministerio de Salud y Protección Social definirá el porcentaje de la prima de aseguramiento que podrá ser usada en gastos de administración, basado en criterios de eficiencia, estudios actuariales, financieros y criterios técnicos, así como los conceptos que conforman dicho gasto. Este porcentaje no podrá superar el 8% de la prima de aseguramiento”.    
>  
>Entonces, el término “prima de aseguramiento” genera confusión y resistencia entre la comunidad médica opuesta al proyecto por las implicaciones que esta podría tener en la práctica. “Al artículo \[22\] se le tiene que mejorar la redacción porque confunde un concepto que es la Unidad de Pago por Capitación con otro concepto que es la prima de aseguramiento. Ahí no puede haber ninguna duda”, expuso el director general de la Asociación Colombiana de Hospitales y Clínicas, ACHC, Juan Carlos Giraldo, en una [intervención](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47s6MmLhxBE) ante el Congreso a principios de noviembre.

>  
>“El proyecto de ley cambia el nombre de las EPS, pero no está cambiando la estructura de cómo funcionan en este momento. Lo que tiene Colombia es un sistema de aseguramiento en salud que se financia con las contribuciones salariales. En el proyecto creo que todo eso sigue. No es como en Estados Unidos, por ejemplo, que la gente tiene que salir a comprar un seguro privado en salud, como se compra un seguro privado de carros o un seguro privado de casas. No es ese cambio el que se está dando”.   
>  
>Finalmente, hay que aclarar que el proyecto crea un Régimen Único de Salud, según el texto de la iniciativa, para poner fin a los regímenes Contributivo y Subsidiado. Pero para Vélez, eso no significa “que la gente de Régimen Subsidiado va a entrar a pagar al Régimen Único como pagan los que están en el Régimen Contributivo, sino que se quiere equiparar los beneficios”.   
>  
>Según nos explicó la médica, esto tampoco es nada nuevo “porque se supone que esa diferencia entre los regímenes en cuestiones de beneficios ya no existía legalmente desde la [Sentencia T 760 \[de 2008\]](https://consultorsalud.com/como-la-sentencia-t-760-2008-cambio-el-sistema-de-salud/#:~:text=La%20sentencia%20T%2D760%2C%20es,como%20un%20derecho%20fundamental%20aut%C3%B3nomo.)”. "
"Ive read the reform, not the pics everyone and their mom is sharing. 

And yeah, it doesn’t say anything about any of the things I told you about, which are definitely in the reform. The article is talking about REGIMENES ESPECIALES which is another bag of potatoes, and about curriculums and privatizations I never mentioned. So yeah, you have yet to tell me WHERE AND WHEN THE POINTS I TOUCHED WERE APPROVED."
"Oh my god, if I knew you did not even read the Senate law by yourself I would have not wanted my time writing such long comment in order to discuss it with you.

Evidently you are not taking this seriously so please stop copying and pasting and do some research on your own. I know these texts are complicated but please make some effort before you make others waste their time."
That happens in an ideal world where people respect the lockdowns...
"I am not painting austerity as a bad word. The problem is it is always used as a solution during recessions, which is incredibly dangerous.

Any sort of austerity, such as cut in public spending, raising taxes, reducing welfare benefits, is by its own nature, a contractionary fiscal policy. Which means it works as a way to reduce a country's GDP, which is precisely what you DO NOT want during a recession.

Also, there are a platitude of many economic papers claiming that trying to reduce the deficit or the public debt during a recession will only make things worse because it will contract the countries GDP and, as consequence, reduce tax revenue, worsening the public finance situation.

First thing here about ""debt and money printing"", this is a monetarist tenet, which is not something that is accepted very easily by most economists today, especially after 2008. The most you can say about ""money printing"" and the ensuing inflation is only on the long-run, which is over many years. I don't think many people will care about the long-run if your economy completely collapses in the short-run because you refuse to induce an expansionary fiscal policy.

Second, recessions will always raise the level of uncertainty in any country, which will always reduce the investment rate and increase unemployment, and it will go down on a spiral of collapses until government raises the bar through fiscal policy, offering a ""floor"" to fall upon.

Third, Latin American countries suffer from short-term inflation which is not caused by money printing, which is also another hot debate, because you can consider that the Central Bank does not even control the monetary base, it only controls the interest rate. The main problems in many inflationary processes are because of two things: a huge consumer demand of foreign goods and a volatile national currency.

Recession happens > investment rate reduces > unemployment raises > investment rate reduces again because of high unemployment > more people are laid off and unemployment raises again > and so on.

Fiscal policy can work as means to increase the investment rate, if a government start to build large infrastructure projects, this will raise the level of demand necessary for private enterprises to start hiring again and a recovery will ensue.

">I am not painting austerity as a bad word. The problem is it is always used as a solution during recessions, which is incredibly dangerous.

It is, but there comes a point when sacrifices need to be made and a crisis is the perfect opportunity to make changes. It's time to stop this overspending we have.

>Also, there are a platitude of many economic papers claiming that trying to reduce the deficit or the public debt during a recession will only make things worse because it will contract the countries GDP and, as consequence, reduce tax revenue, worsening the public finance situation.

Obviously a reduction in public spending has to come with some other changes especially in commerce and trade. I recognize that bluntly reducing public spending can be tough (but necessary).

>First thing here about ""debt and money printing"", this is a monetarist tenet, which is not something that is accepted very easily by most economists today, especially after 2008. The most you can say about ""money printing"" and the ensuing inflation is only on the long-run, which is over many years. I don't think many people will care about the long-run if your economy completely collapses in the short-run because you refuse to induce a expansionary fiscal policy. 

I'm not offended when people call me monetarist. If wanting a solid and stable currency with minimal inflation makes me a monetarist, so be it. Inflation is a punishment for the working class. It's awful and being ""on the long-run"" doesn't make it any better.

>Third, Latin American countries suffer from short-term inflation which is not caused by money printing, which is also another hot debate, because you can consider that the Central Bank does not even control the monetary base, it only controls the interest rate. The main problems in many inflationary processes is because of two things: a huge consumer demand of foreign goods and a volatile national currency. 

I have identified three or four main causes of inflation. I partially agree with you that it's not always monetary, but it is one the main causes. Increases in basic costs, demand and currency exchange rates are also factors. However, this varies by country.

>Fiscal policy can work as means to increase the investment rate, if a government start to build large infrastructure projects, this will raise the level of demand necessary for private enterprises to start hiring again and a recovery will ensue. 

I live in a country where people always scream that the government must build infrastructure projects to ""move the economy"". This is such a Keynesian and short-sighted concept. I am not against public spending on infrastructure projects per se. I am against it being such an essential force in the national economy. These projects are usually financed with debt which can spiral out of control quickly.

>People have to stop thinking that public finance is the same as household finance.

Keynesians say that all time to justify weak currencies, high deficits and high levels of public debt. I know it's not the same but having a tightly controlled spending helps a lot. We have become so used to Keynesianism that we really think there's no other way."
"That's true, but it's a tense moment in that times with economic crisis tend to be the ones that cause war. For example the 1930s, and 1970s. I don't think we need to renew the whole fleet, but definitely a fighter or two is needed. 

But more of a priority is the financing of the solidarity wages, the introduction of income tax and the show of capacity to pay the foreign debt, so we don't have inflation destroying our economy. Every part of the Colombian economy needs imports to run, be it machinery, raw materials, services, etc. If our currency weakens further, and we have inflation, all of that will go up and we'll see price rises in every good. And it will have to come with austerity, which means reducing the new excellent highways being built, the new education budget, and everything else. 

We needed this reform. It was going to be a bitch to swallow, but it was going to feed us in the long term."

">It is, but there comes a point when sacrifices need to be made and a crisis is the perfect opportunity to make changes. It's time to stop this overspending we have.

The practical result from you solution is worsening the recession. Regardless of what you think about it, it will happen, GDP will keep contracting and it will become worse.

Also, considering this is Latin America, sacrifices on whom? Because if I am going to apply my experience from Brazil, the burden will always be on poor people, never the rich. And the ones who always says ""shock therapy and sacrifices"" are the rich, who will mostly not suffer if the GDP drops by -6%.

You have to understand that, after 2008, many things Milton Friedman has said comes with a lot of criticisms. This thing about ""shock therapy"" is probably one of the most dangerous concepts I, as an economist, have ever seen in my life. Just go see post-soviet countries that went under this ""shock therapy"" and their standards of living from 1992-2008.

How are we going to deal with the structural effects a shock therapy may ensue? Are these effects strong enough to create a situation similar to Eastern Europe?

>I'm not offended when people call me monetarist. If wanting a solid and stable currency with minimal inflation makes me a monetarist, so be it. Inflation is a punishment for the working class. It's awful and being ""on the long-run"" doesn't make it any better.

First, IF THE conditions necessary for a ""solid and stable currency"", requires a strong industry, high education levels, a consumer base strong enough to stand currency shocks, how you can make that happen? Even more so in a ""underdeveloped country"" or a ""middle-income country""? It is not an easy answer, and it may require a help from government intervention.

Second, inflation is a game of hot potato, you always want to pass the increasing costs down, trying to marginalize the effects upon you, this idea of ""inflation is a tax on the poor"" may hold some value, but I find it misleading at best and dishonest at worst. Yes, high inflation is awful, but then again, pressing problems on the short-run will make everything useless in the long-run.

Third, there is some value on ""trade liberalization"", meaning countries with more closed economies are more susceptible to internal inflationary shocks since the demand market has not international option.

&#x200B;

>I live in a country where people always scream that the government must build infrastructure projects to ""move the economy"". This is such a Keynesian and short-sighted concept. I am not against public spending on infrastructure projects per se. I am against it being such an essential force in the national economy. These projects are usually financed with debt which can spiral out of control quickly.

You have to understand that private companies will simply not invest in large infrastructure projects, and countries that are trying to achieve a high standard of living will need to undertake those projects if they want to get there.

There is no single example in human history of a country going through industrialization that did not do it. The post-war economic miracles of Germany, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and later China, are great examples of this.

How the hell do you want to make it easier for export industries in your country to increase production and connect to international markets without these projects, though magic?

>Keynesians say that all time to justify weak currencies, high deficits and high levels of public debt. I know it's not the same but having a tightly controlled spending helps a lot. We have become so used to Keynesianism that we really think there's no other way.

Dude, you have to understand that ""Keynesianism"" only agrees with high deficits and high levels of public debt during recessions. And having  tightly controlled spending is not always something you want to have, specially during a recession.

It's not that ""we are so used to Keynesianism"" is that it has proven to be a better alternative than trying to control the short-run fluctuations of GDP exclusively through monetary policy, even more so for developing countries."
They believe in eternally growing debt. That's the measure of their nonsense.
">but definitely a fighter or two is needed.

Totally agree. But they wanted to buy the whole fleet at once, that's the goddamn problem.

Jay, I agree with your second paragraph up to your solution. **This** reform (what was proposed or intended to propose) was not needed. What Duque needed to do is to follow the recommendations done by the Expert Commitee he tasked almost 2 years ago. Those recommendations are pretty different to what was proposed.

Do you honestly think that exemptions in certain sector cannot be dropped? That the country hasn't taken tax and trade decisions shooting itself in the foot? This is the extreme case when drastic measures could have been taken and for once in our history we could reacted to a crisis by helping the demand side not the supply side. But here we go again."

The thing is that if taxes keep increasing to finance uncontrolled public spending and to pay for the ever growing public debt, the poor and the middle class will be the most affected by it.

>How the hell do you want to make it easier for export industries in your country to increase production and connect to international markets without these projects, though magic?

I do not think the USA stations fighter jets outside the USA apart from Puerto Rico which itself is also far away from South America in terms of a fighting plane range.

Why people like you insist to deprive Colombia from proper military gear? Are you getting your military news from TeleSUR or RT?"
"Como le dije al otro, ya mismo voy a preguntar pais por pais si ellos estan peores que nosotros para ver si entonces tenemos permiso para protestar según usted."
Ojala estar en esa Colombia de la dimensión paralela en la que vivis donde no pasa nada.
Moral rules aren't debate rules.

">The USA keeps a presence in the seas not because they want to topple Maduro

What does this have to do with this?

>I do not think the USA stations fighter jets outside the USA apart from Puerto Rico which itself is also far away from South America in terms of a fighting plane range.

Incirlik air base is at 900 km from Deiz-er-Zor, so I say they're pretty well within fighter jet range even if you start at Puerto Rico, more with the US air-to-air standoff capabilities

>Why people like you insist to deprive Colombia from proper military gear?

Because a) There's no _inminent_ threat of war against a state and the citizen wellbeing is a more pressing matter right now b) Because the inminent threat is internal, and a whole fleet of F-16 are overkill for such task, as what is truly required are CAS capabilities (via drones or via other specialized fixed wing aircraft like the A-10), which can be cheaper. c) Because if the colombian air force want to get new toys as the F-16, they could buy them gradually in several years while upgrading the avionics and not buy inmediately all full price in the current situation.

>Are you getting your military news from TeleSUR or RT? 

I don't watch them. But do you watch Fox News or RCN by any chance?

Once again, you're showing you have no fucking idea about this topic."
"I support the tax reform precisely because I live in the real Colombia needing to rebuild its economy after the havoc caused by the pandemic

Those not feeling the pain cannot understand the need to rebuild the economy and maybe that's why they oppose tax reforms."
"CAS planes won't deter Sukhois ever.

CAS are intended for assiting infantry operations and a Super Tucano won't stand a change against a fighting jet, not even a KFir, let alone a Sukhoi from Venezuela."
Estoy seguro que los pobres no sienten lo mal que va la economía. Seguro.
"A CAS plane is for use against internal enemy forces, as I have told you thrice, we have no *inminent* conflict with another state. I haven't seen the Clan del Golfo or the FARC dissidences contesting the airspace so far."
So they're opposing out of ignorance instead of out of not having unresolved needs? Thanks for agreeing with me.
"You keep deflecting the fact that I'm talking about Venezuela, why?"
"Los pobres no tienen que hacer magister en economía para entender que las cosas estan mal. Es así de sencillo. El punto donde nos podiamos excusar de que era ignorancia lo pasamos hace rato porque  ningún gobierno les ha respondido.

Cuando llevan tanto presidente y congresos chimbos, creo que sobre que se tengan que detener a leer pagina por pagina porque sí fue malo o porque no."
Because there's no *inminent* threat of conflict with them!! Do you know what priorities are? Do you know the meaning of inminent?
"As I told you no country arms itself right before a conflict, doing so is the polar opposite of deterrence.

When a country has a weapon, it makes other countries to know that so they refrain from any military action against the former.

They do not go shopping for gear weeks or days in advance because gear shippings can take months or even years."
Have you seen Argentina shopping for war against Chile nowadays? Or Ecuador shopping for war against Perú?
">Have you seen Argentina shopping for war ...

Ecuador is not exactly a example to follow, even if you daydream Latin American peacefulness fantasies."
