So they proposed several taxes last year including more income tax hikes and tripling property taxes. This resulted in a series of protests which made the government backpedal.\\n\\nThey learned from the experience and now introduced the new reform as part of the IMF commitments, with the most vague and surreptitious wording, trying to confuse people and avoid more protests. Things are astonishingly similar to Colombia: lowering the exempt ceiling and changing income thresholds that at least for me will result in a very hefty tax burden increase. It will be interesting to see what happens here when it enters  actual discussion (the government does not have a majority and there are elections next year), so this unfortunate Colombia case can point a bit to what can happen here.</td>\n",

              "4    It's interesting to see that the proposed tax reform for Colombia is very similar to the one the Costa Rican government is trying to pass as part of its commitments to the IMF for a relief plan.\\n\\nCR is in a similar deficit situation and, thanks to the pandemic, the previous fiscal reform (from 2018 which saw VAT added to services and income tax hikes) showed how short sighted it was in not doing anything to curb spending. So they proposed several taxes last year including more income tax hikes and tripling property taxes. This resulted in a series of protests which made the government backpedal.\\n\\nThey learned from the experience and now introduced the new reform as part of the IMF commitments, with the most vague and surreptitious wording, trying to confuse people and avoid more protests. Things are astonishingly similar to Colombia: lowering the exempt ceiling and changing income thresholds that at least for me will result in a very hefty tax burden increase. It will be interesting to see what happens here when it enters  actual discussion (the government does not have a majority and there are elections next year), so this unfortunate Colombia case can point a bit to what can happen here.\n",

It was invented as a boogeyman by the democrat left in the United States and later got exported to the rest of the world. Market liberalism would never propose a capitalism model based on \"charity\" or vertical growth. Modern microeconomic theory is based on individual choice, action and motivation. \\n\\n99% seems a pretty arbritary number.\n",

So they proposed several taxes last year including more income tax hikes and tripling property taxes. This resulted in a series of protests which made the government backpedal.\\n\\nThey learned from the experience and now introduced the new reform as part of the IMF commitments, with the most vague and surreptitious wording, trying to confuse people and avoid more protests. Things are astonishingly similar to Colombia: lowering the exempt ceiling and changing income thresholds that at least for me will result in a very hefty tax burden increase. It will be interesting to see what happens here when it enters  actual discussion (the government does not have a majority and there are elections next year), so this unfortunate Colombia case can point a bit to what can happen here.</td>\n",

              "4     It's interesting to see that the proposed tax reform for Colombia is very similar to the one the Costa Rican government is trying to pass as part of its commitments to the IMF for a relief plan.\\n\\nCR is in a similar deficit situation and, thanks to the pandemic, the previous fiscal reform (from 2018 which saw VAT added to services and income tax hikes) showed how short sighted it was in not doing anything to curb spending. So they proposed several taxes last year including more income tax hikes and tripling property taxes. This resulted in a series of protests which made the government backpedal.\\n\\nThey learned from the experience and now introduced the new reform as part of the IMF commitments, with the most vague and surreptitious wording, trying to confuse people and avoid more protests. Things are astonishingly similar to Colombia: lowering the exempt ceiling and changing income thresholds that at least for me will result in a very hefty tax burden increase. It will be interesting to see what happens here when it enters  actual discussion (the government does not have a majority and there are elections next year), so this unfortunate Colombia case can point a bit to what can happen here.\n",

Reddit también siempre está en el limbo entre progresismo y a veces pensamiento lógico. \\n\\nUno pensaría que porque se empapan más de conocimiento aquí pensarían pero no, aquí son a veces igual de basura que en Facebook.\n",
