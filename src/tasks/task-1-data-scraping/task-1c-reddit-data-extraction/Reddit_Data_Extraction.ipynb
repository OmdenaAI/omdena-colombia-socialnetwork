Healthcare is actually not a bad deal because that covers your health insurance, although EPS's are a useless nightmare a lot of the time, it's still a tax payment though. Pensions on the other hand require a ridiculous amount of weeks (1300 or 25 years of non-stop work compared to the US's 10)  to pay into to get benefits which is why nearly 80% of people who have official jobs, never actually qualify for pensions.

If they want to change the country, be reasonable, and not ask for less taxes and more subsidies. Colombia has no money, and we're getting more and more in debt. The dollar is skyrocketing. Cities are having food shortages, hundreds of millions of pesos are being lost every hour in people not working and blockades around the country. Duque has to scramble the military, as the people have destroyed way too much, and if there is no intervention from the military now, it may be too late until the country is unrepairable. A protest is just a day and sends a clear and concise message, this is becoming young people requesting outrageous demands, and using this as a way to skip off their responsabilities, as the amount of damage they are doing by protesting are making their demands even harder to put into order, as the government has to restore our country before doing anything else. You don't \"fix\" a country by destroying its public transport, or its Capitol, or hundred's of entrepenours bussiness.

            ">Entonces, agrega el médico Mario Hernández, “lo que está pasando en este proyecto de ley es que el Gobierno quiere darle un incentivo a las EPS para llamarlas aseguradoras y que se comporten como aseguradoras \\[es decir, que se ocupen de la gestión del riesgo en salud\\]. Pero ellas dicen ‘¡ah! Si usted me va a tratar como aseguradora y me va a poner un porcentaje de administración y el resto para servicios, entonces yo no le jalo. Porque si me va a tratar como una aseguradora, me tiene que transferir esos recursos como una póliza, como una póliza de seguro empresarial, igual que en cualquier empresa privada de seguros. Esa es la confusión que tiene ese proyecto de ley”.  \n",
            ">  \n",
            ">Explica Hernández que “incluso, el proyecto de ley, como es hecho a varias manos y con esa doble intencionalidad, no hablan de pólizas sino de ‘primas de aseguramiento’ y eso es lo que en el análisis de este proyecto crea una confusión terrible, porque la plata no es una prima de aseguramiento \\[no son recursos privados\\], en realidad son recursos públicos de destinación específica”.  \n",
            ">  \n",
            ">Hay que recordar que, de acuerdo con el [artículo 25 de la Ley 1751 de 2015](https://www.minsalud.gov.co/Normatividad_Nuevo/Ley%201751%20de%202015.pdf), los recursos públicos que financian la salud son inembargables, tienen destinación específica y no podrán ser dirigidos a fines diferentes a los previstos constitucional y legalmente.   \n",
            ">  \n",
            ">En efecto, en el artículo 22 del proyecto se precisa que “el Ministerio de Salud y Protección Social definirá el porcentaje de la prima de aseguramiento que podrá ser usada en gastos de administración, basado en criterios de eficiencia, estudios actuariales, financieros y criterios técnicos, así como los conceptos que conforman dicho gasto. Este porcentaje no podrá superar el 8% de la prima de aseguramiento”.    \n",
            ">  \n",
            ">Entonces, el término “prima de aseguramiento” genera confusión y resistencia entre la comunidad médica opuesta al proyecto por las implicaciones que esta podría tener en la práctica. “Al artículo \\[22\\] se le tiene que mejorar la redacción porque confunde un concepto que es la Unidad de Pago por Capitación con otro concepto que es la prima de aseguramiento. Ahí no puede haber ninguna duda”, expuso el director general de la Asociación Colombiana de Hospitales y Clínicas, ACHC, Juan Carlos Giraldo, en una [intervención](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47s6MmLhxBE) ante el Congreso a principios de noviembre.   \n",
            ">  \n",
            ">De hecho, [Marcela Vélez](https://scienti.minciencias.gov.co/cvlac/visualizador/generarCurriculoCv.do?cod_rh=0001385569), doctora en Políticas de Salud y profesora del Instituto de Investigaciones Médicas de la Universidad de Antioquia, nos explicó la cuestión en estas palabras:   \n",
            ">  \n",
            ">“El proyecto de ley cambia el nombre de las EPS, pero no está cambiando la estructura de cómo funcionan en este momento. Lo que tiene Colombia es un sistema de aseguramiento en salud que se financia con las contribuciones salariales. En el proyecto creo que todo eso sigue. No es como en Estados Unidos, por ejemplo, que la gente tiene que salir a comprar un seguro privado en salud, como se compra un seguro privado de carros o un seguro privado de casas. No es ese cambio el que se está dando”.   \n",
            ">  \n",
            ">Finalmente, hay que aclarar que el proyecto crea un Régimen Único de Salud, según el texto de la iniciativa, para poner fin a los regímenes Contributivo y Subsidiado. Pero para Vélez, eso no significa “que la gente de Régimen Subsidiado va a entrar a pagar al Régimen Único como pagan los que están en el Régimen Contributivo, sino que se quiere equiparar los beneficios”.   \n",
            ">  \n",
            ">Según nos explicó la médica, esto tampoco es nada nuevo “porque se supone que esa diferencia entre los regímenes en cuestiones de beneficios ya no existía legalmente desde la [Sentencia T 760 \\[de 2008\\]](https://consultorsalud.com/como-la-sentencia-t-760-2008-cambio-el-sistema-de-salud/#:~:text=La%20sentencia%20T%2D760%2C%20es,como%20un%20derecho%20fundamental%20aut%C3%B3nomo.)”. \n",

              "4    It's interesting to see that the proposed tax reform for Colombia is very similar to the one the Costa Rican government is trying to pass as part of its commitments to the IMF for a relief plan.\\n\\nCR is in a similar deficit situation and, thanks to the pandemic, the previous fiscal reform (from 2018 which saw VAT added to services and income tax hikes) showed how short sighted it was in not doing anything to curb spending. So they proposed several taxes last year including more income tax hikes and tripling property taxes. This resulted in a series of protests which made the government backpedal.\\n\\nThey learned from the experience and now introduced the new reform as part of the IMF commitments, with the most vague and surreptitious wording, trying to confuse people and avoid more protests. Things are astonishingly similar to Colombia: lowering the exempt ceiling and changing income thresholds that at least for me will result in a very hefty tax burden increase. It will be interesting to see what happens here when it enters  actual discussion (the government does not have a majority and there are elections next year), so this unfortunate Colombia case can point a bit to what can happen here.\n",
